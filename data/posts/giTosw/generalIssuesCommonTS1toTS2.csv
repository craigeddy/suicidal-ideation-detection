Sure I had small bouts of hopelessness as the days went by, but nothing so bad as the week before. I had hope. I had a doctors appointment today and she prescribed me Praxil. I was looking forward to starting the medication. Maybe it might help me like it helped my sister. 

Then my father called. 

Just a little background information; My father and mother split some years ago, and he still resents that fact. He thinks living with my mother is making me unhappy, so he tells me I can move in with him at every opportunity. He also stresses the fact he wants me to be successful. He also tends to let it slip that my mother and my boyfriend are both sinning and how he is the victim, and how I should stay with him. Ninety percent of the time he calls he is also intoxicated, which enhances his ability to be a gigantic asshole, insulting and threatening my mother and her boyfriend if I put him on the phone with them. 

So my sister must of told him I had an appointment today, since that was the first thing he brought up. I told him I was prescribed anti-depressants, then he proceeded to ask me **why I was depressed.** Of course I don't have an exact answer, so he proceeds to heavily imply I'm unhappy because I live with my mother. I have no backbone so I just let him go on. 

Then he goes on about how much I need to stay in school. He doesn't know I flunked out three months ago due to my depression. I was failing miserably and decided to stop sinking money into work I wasn't doing. This is the quote that really got to me: 

*""You need to go for the gold. The silvers not good enough. Less than silver isn't good enough either. You need to go and do the best and be the best.""* 

By this point I feel immensely guilty for everything in my entire life. He kept going on about how much he loves me and how much he misses he. I felt like the biggest disappointment and asshole in the world and all of those negative emotions came flooding back. 

By this point in my life, I'm pretty sure talking to him is my biggest trigger. I always feel guilty and horrible and like the worst daughter who ever lived. My doctor today commented it sounded like I had a lot of people around who loved me and would support me, but how am I supposed to let them when I feel like offing myself for bothering them or making them worry?

Then I came back up to school and everything seems to be falling apart.
My best friend graduated last semester.  He's in Thailand and isn't coming back until May.  I promised him I wouldn't cut myself but it's very tempting right now.  He's the only person who every noticed when I did.  
My other friend won't really talk to me anymore.  I told him I felt self-destructive and he said ""Kay, goodnight.""  He's kind of a tough-love kind of guy.  I'm not sure if talking to him would be beneficial, if he would tell me to get over it, or if he would want me to go to a hospital.  My experience has always been that once I come clean about what's going on in my head, people stop talking to me.  That's why I haven't told my godsister or my parents about any of this.
My roommate doesn't believe I have depression.  He calls me lazy, says I have no self control, makes fun of me for sleeping all the time, and rolls his eyes if he sees I've been crying.  Another tough-love guy I guess, but it doesn't help.
My best friend, mentioned above, is the only person who really listened when I talked about it.  He was put off at first but has really been a support for me.  Now that he's gone I feel really alone.  I am literally alone ALL THE TIME.  I used up all my therapy time in the school's counseling center, and the new therapist I called hasn't called me back.
What I would tell a therapist: I want to break my promise to my friend and start hurting myself.  I'm sort of starving myself/side effect of Zoloft is no appetite.  If no one will believe what's in my head, then maybe if there's physical proof they will listen.

I had an amazing V-Day. Had a great time with the girl of my dreams and and was on a great ""high"" all night.  

This morning I had dance rehearsal, and after dance I felt an intense sense of love as a kissed and parted from my partner. I walked to the subway and I passed a building where my ex said this guy worked. He was a photographer, and he was known for taking advantage of underage girls and molesting them. He did this to my girlfriend while I was dating her, and would try to force sex with her in exchange for photos. He forcefully fingerfucked her and made threats if she ever told. I promised myself I would harm him greatly if I ever saw him.  

So I saw the door open for the first time, as it's usually locked. Some people got buzzed in, and as I look through the stain glass, I see that motherfucker right there looking exactly how he did in his facebook page. I tap on the glass and they look apprehensive to open the door.  

Eventually he opens the door.   

I say ""Are you ____ ______?""   
He says ""Yes""
I immediately feel a primal fight-or-flight response. I brace my self, and give him a strong right straight punch to his nose/lip area.   

He falls flat on his back.   
A buff security guard yells ""HEY!"" and starts chasing me   

Mind you this is in broad daylight on Hollywood Blvd  

I run away from him yelling, ""He's a fucking child moleste. Fuck you, you fucking Pedophile""  

The security guard isn't sure what to do.  

I see blood coming down the dude's face as he's laying on the ground and people are trying to help him recover. I yell the name of the my ex girlfriend he molested, and he has this stunned look in his eyes.   

Meanwhile I know I need to get out of there.  
The security guard follows me around, on his cell, obviously talking to cops describing what I'm wearing.  I dash across the street to the subway station, a homeless guy actually creates a distraction for me and helps me get across during the green light.  

I walk down to the subway, change my clothes, wrap my hair up with a tshirt to hide my hair, and catch the subway to another part of town to meet with a friend for lunch.  

This is the second time in the last 2 months I got violent towards a sexual predator. I know that these men aren't the problem, but rather, I'm placing my anger upon them and using them as targets to take my anger out on them.  

However, part of me feels very protective, and needing to bring sickos like this to justice. These women are scared to report, either from shame, or fear, or wanting to forget about. Meanwhile the pedophiles continue walking amongst us unpunished. I felt it necessary to do justice with my hands since there was really no other way if the girls arent willing to cough up what happened.   

Neither of these men were punished, so I finished business for them.  

I'm afraid, though, this might not be the last time I end up in this situation, and I don't know how to creatively bring these people to justice. MAybe I'm no batman, but I've had people close to me get abducted and it hits really close to home. I feel like a coward if I just back down and don't do anything.  

I want to find a logical alternative but there really doesn't seem to be a socially acceptable way to treat sexual predators. Honestly, if the  security guard wasn't there, I would have given him a much worse beating. There just seems to be an instinct that overrides all anger-management fortifications I have built up when it comes to this kind of stuff.

i live in california, my (now ex) girlfriend lives in miami, florida. i hadn't seen her in 8 months, and i finally was able to see her. we had broken up a few days before due to me being unstable with my self-destructive behaviors. we talked it over though that me coming was okay. 
i fly in, we're both excited to see eachother. i get in her car and kiss her face a ton of times, clearly excited. first thing i get? ""you're acting strange. i don't get it.""
we get to her place, she says i'm acting weird when i'm doing nothing wrong. she is the one acting sketchy and making everything awkward. she then proceeds to yell at me through the night and i eventually fell asleep at 6 am, only to wake up early and get her breakfast to maybe make things settle. nope.
get back, she's still short and cold towards me.
she then drives me to my dads house and leaves me there, hasn't talked to me since and has been blogging about how she hates me, saying i made her hate everything. 
and now she's moving on apparently, whatever that means. 
i can provide more backstory if someone cares to even comment.
it's been almost 2 months since i got dropped off at my dads place.

 * They have a non-supportive and possibly sinister agenda, and they're preying on your because they think they can fool you when you're vulnerable.

At first, I didn't think anything of it. Just something ""they"" said.

All the traits, or characteristics, really really seem to fit. One person in particular said something like: ""they switch to a personality that they think you want"" and ""always wearing a mask"". And that's exactly how I feel. I mean, I have no idea how I feel or think about things, I just know what certain people in my life would think and I tend to agree with it. 

Other things I read is that people like me aren't able to function in school settings, or workplaces. I dropped out of high school, and im not able to keep a job foe more than 3 months without me ruining it for myself and somehow justifying it. So, I guess the point is, what does this say about my future? Am I doomed to feel the way I feel? I hate the idea of taking medications and seeing therapists. It just seems wrong to me. The medications can leave you more fucked up than you were in the first place, which I've seen and experienced first hand. I've been in a couple different behavioral health centers for self harm and suicidal ideations. I've completely grown out of the whole self harm thing, I just think its asking for attention.

I know its selfish, but I can't help it. Its so hard trying to keep my head up and continue looking for a light at the end of the tunnel.

I'm a 17 year old kid with depression.  I've been lurking here for a while, since before my diagnosis even, and I have come to share my story.  It's not happy, or even sad.  Or even interesting for all it's worth.  

From 4th grade to 8th grade, I was verbally bullied by the kids (and 1 teacher) that I went to school with.  The school was small, and everyone knew everyone.  I was a quiet and shy one, and that made it look like I didn't care if I was picked on or whatever.  The reality was, my self-esteem was completely eradicated by the time I graduated from that hell-hole.  

l moved on to 9th grade at a gigantic high school and nearly flunked out in the first grading period.  I got my shit together, and made a few friends along the way.  

10th grade I got a girlfriend.  She lived next door to my grandmother, we met while I was doing yard work.  She struggled with a lot of the bullying issues I did, and we did the best to help each other out.    

Our relationship ended in my 11th grade year, because the distance was just too much of an issue for me, I was obsessing over her and what she was doing constantly, I would have nightmares wherein she would be cheating on me.  It just became too much to bear.  I still love her, it's too tough to forget her.  

12th grade flew by, as I graduated at the midyear point, at the end of my first semester.  Over summer break I landed a job at Arby's and I am still there today, making sandwiches and taking orders.  Towards the last few weeks of my HS career, my counselor said I need to go to the stress center, because I had a plan to kill myself and the appropriate means to make it happen.  I ended up spending a week in youth inpatient care, 2 weeks before I was supposed to graduate.  I barely scraped by my required math class, and here we are today.  Arby's is literally my life.  I get roughly 20hrs/week and it's not enough to keep me entertained.  I feel useless sitting around the house, but there's nothing I take pleasure in doing anymore.  Buying new things only gets me so far, being on minimum wage and all.  I've been on lexapro for a few months, and it has helped immensely, but I still fail to find purpose in my life, unless I'm at work.  

Thank you all for listening to my tale of life, love, and Arby's.  ",depression,t5_2qqqf,My Story. Not like it's even worth telling.

whenever I have a really good time afterwards I tend to feel empty, numb, absent or like I could have done a better job to make the most of it.

I love socializing and having a good time with friends and doing things. It's almost an intense emotional high. After going on a day out with friends and I get home, alone, it's quiet, it feels like there's static playing in the background, like you used to get on old televisions. It's a feeling of '...what now?'

Is there a low for every high?

I also have trouble dealing with thoughts of losing my close friends and family. I love and appreciate my parents beyond comprehension, but I know the day/s that they die will be the darkest moments of my life. So every happy moment I spend with them is bitter-sweet because I know at some point it's going to happen. I wish I could express in words or actions how much I appreciate and love them but I feel incapable of doing so. I also feel like they deserve more from me, because they are such good parents, they don't ask much of me but I feel like I owe them the world. I want to give them back the same that they have given to me, but again I feel incapable.

I also left my home country on the other side of the world ~2 years ago with the family. I left behind all of my closest friends and my older brother (it was the hardest day of my life). This month one of my old-friends visited me, I had a great time with him an we did a lot of stuff, but he left today to go back and after he left I felt the same feelings I described before, like I could have made so much more and savored every minute with him because now he's gone again and I might not see him again for a long time.

It's a bit of a paradox, because when you see people a lot you start to take them for granted, but it's not til they're gone you realize what you've lost. 

It's like I recognize this and try to appreciate my close friends/family, but when I try to it's like the immovable feeling is just there staring me in the face and I still feel like I could have done more for them.

I have gotten plenty of birthday wishes on Facebook, some e-mails, text messages, and voicemails, but I still feel so empty.  Perhaps it is because of what I didn't get, or who I haven't heard from.

Mostly, my brother and his family, no call, no card--NOTHING.  It makes me sad on so many levels, especially since I constantly hear the stories from my sister of crazy texts he sends her.  I'm not crying because I feel entitled to some sort of gift, and frankly, a card would be enough.  I just feel so broken.

Maybe that is the problem, I'm just broken, and after a bit of an up time, my world is crashing down and there isn't really anything I can do about it.  Medication hasn't helped, been in therapy for 7 years on an almost weekly basis, even tried ECT.  Here I sit a very broken woman.   I had some much hope for life after 30, but I guess things don't work out the way you plan, or the way you think they will.

30 was an OK year, I lost over 100 pounds, but I still hear from doctors that I need to lose more.  They are right, but why are they unable to see my progress?  All I want is a pat on the back, and some encouragement to do more.  Maybe I sound like a child, but I need to feel like someone is in my corner.

After years of no work, I finally took that step, I'm not working a glamourous job--just as a cashier, but I am trying, but it doesn't feel like enough.  Doing more, or trying to do more seems so scary, though.  Failing again just doesn't seem like something I can survive.

In grad school I was in decent shape, but after getting a job a couple years ago I'm now more alone, 60 pounds fatter.  I hate my job and I despise going in every day.

I have no ability to control myself.  I can't get myself to do anything like go out or work out. I can barely get myself to go out and even get food sometimes.

I want to go do things but I can't just go do them alone.  I need help.  I need friends or something to drive me.  Now I have no dreams or goals, just emptiness and sadness.  I hate where I am in my life and I have no ability to affect change in my life.

The last few months have been terribly hard. I started noticing problems when I developed insomnia. I never had this problem before and thought it was just a phase. I'm having problems with my family and my boyfriend and I'm stressed out by school and work, so I just attributed the insomnia to being worried about everything. The last two weeks have been worse because my insomnia has gone away, but it's been replaced by extreme fatigue. It's understandable that I would crash after hardly getting any sleep for the last few months, but I just don't want to function. I haven't told anyone that I've been skipping classes these past few weeks just because I go somewhere else to sleep. Now I realize that this problem is serious and I'm scared.


I have a wonderful boyfriend who I planned to move in with this month. We've been dating for over a year, but our time together is extremely limited because my mom hates my boyfriend for no good reason. She doesn't like our age difference (I'm 20, he's 25) and she throws my things out on the street or locks me out of the house when I go out with him. I never see him outside of school (we go to the same college). I've been reluctant to move in with my boyfriend because I am financially dependent on my mother. In addition, my mom and I lost our rental apartment a few months ago and we had to move in with my grandparents. My grandmother is verbally abusive to my mom and I. My mom has been depressed because she's been unemployed for over 2 years and can't get a job and being with my grandparents have made matters worse.


I started packing to leave this week and I had a panic attack. I feel guilty about whatever I choose to do. I feel guilty if I leave my mom because despite her behavior, she sacrificed a lot for me and saved me many times. If I don't leave, I feel sick because I'll disappoint my boyfriend who has patiently waited for me to make a decision. People have told me to leave my boyfriend, but I really love him. I don't want to jinx anything, but I do want a future with him and I'm committed to him. He has offered to help me and has opened his home to me. He volunteered to go with me to the bank and apply for a loan. I recently got my loan processed and I'm waiting for the outcome, but it takes everything in me to hold it together in the bank. I couldn't ask him to be there with me. I don't want to choose between the two people I love the most.  


We've broken up before because the constraints put on our relationship takes a toll on us, especially him. I went to counseling after the break up because I was just a mess, but I don't really think it helped. I've had psychiatric evaluations before when I was younger because it was ordered by the court when my parents divorced. The past evaluations feel similar to the ones I've gone through recently. The people I talk to seem to brush off my problems because I seem ""fine"" meaning nothing else in my life has gone downhill. I maintain a high GPA, a good job and I have friends, so I guess my problems don't raise a red flag. I tried explaining that I had to adapt to circumstance to maintain these things. I can't remember a time of peace when I was growing up. My parents always fought and they went through a lengthy divorce. My mom and I struggled after the divorce and my dad ceased to be around. I learned to cope with turbulent times because it's a common occurence. I don't know if that makes sense, but that's what I tried telling my counselors and past psychiatrist. 


Now I wonder if I had some sort of depression problem before, but I'm really late to address it. I feel terrible that my boyfriend has to deal with someone that's broken and so indecisive. He walked away from me the other day because I couldn't give him a straight answer of when I would move in with him. I want to move in with him. I just have all these worries about my mom and money... money is such a big issue. I wonder if I'm worrying too much and I'm making a bigger deal out of this than it needs to be. If I leave, will I not have a family anymore? Will my mom and my boyfriend not love me anymore? Will they never talk to me again? 


 Sorry, this post lost its structure. I just feel very tired. I don't want to see or talk to any of my family or friends. Hugs, kisses and ""i love you""s used to help, but now I don't want to be touched. Sometimes I wish I would just disappear and maybe the problems that I cause my mom and my boyfriend would go away too. I just don't want to face anything or anyone anymore.

I'm seeing a professional and everything, and I talk to people about it all the time. It makes me feel better at the time, but in the long run it does not help anything. They give me advice, they give me coping strategies.

But I'm a lazy piece of shit, I always have been. When I get the advice I say ""okay, I'll try it"" and then I never do. Because I'm just to lazy to do that. I feel like I'm falling deeper and deeper into a bottomless pit with no way out.

Out of all of the problems I have, my anger is the root of most of them. My depression is generally the result of shitty decisions I've made while angry that have cost me friends, school grades (I'm in high school), my future, and the respect of those around me. My laziness is not a result of my anger or anything, really, but it's the reason why I can't change. And knowing this sends me further into depression, which in turn makes me more irritable. Which makes me more depressed, etc. At this point I am once again suicidal (Don't worry, I'm too lazy to even kill myself).

Is there like... a pill or something? To help me to get motivation? To help with anger issues? Medication is the only option for me at this point, I just have no motivation even though changing myself is literally the most important thing I would be doing to improve my life.

I really want their help (or maybe just any help) but, well, I just down right hate them.

I feel that any situation where I am the client and they are the professional translates to something like that I am the imbecile and they are then wise doctor. I feel that I am a mere specimen when I am with them and that any reactions I have are not my own, but my mental illness. In short I feel like I am not a person.

Oddly, I dont feel this way when I see my GP for a physical ailment. I guess because when I see a normal doctor, they are fixing my pyshical, mechanical body. But when I see a mental health practitioner, they are fixing my personality and mind, which means my beliefs and everything that makes me me is flawed. I really, really resent that.

I feel that anything I say that contradicts their hypothesis about me can be brushed off as 'crazy talk'. I feel that they think they are playing scientist when they are really just 'emotion whores'.

I fight with them all the time (not psychically, verbally) because I want to feel like I can bring them down to level ground where we have mutual respect. Its like Id say 'sure, I'd love your advice on treatments, but I'm going to tell you if your acting out of line in your questioning'.

For now, I just wanted to post this here:

**I Met a Girl**

    I met a Girl
    Not just any girl
    The nicest, kindest, most understanding girl

    I so very much wanted to be her friend
    I was not looking for a girlfriend
    Just someone I could talk to
    Someone who would understand me
    Someone who at the end of the day, I knew had my back without even asking

    At one point she made a joke about wishing she was dead
    Even knowing it was a joke
    I needed to make sure there wasn’t a single piece of truth in it

    I wanted her to have a friend
    I wanted her to have someone to talk to
    I wanted her to feel like someone understood
    I wanted her to know, without even asking, I would always have her back

    She told me she has a boyfriend
    Which was fine
    I just wanted a friend

    But as time passed
    I didn’t know what to say
    What I shouldn’t say
    If I should say anything
    Or when I could say anything

    I was trying to be myself
    I was trying to show her who I was
    I was trying to show her I cared

    I decided to step back
    I thought she wanted to be my friend
    So I figured I would just follow her lead...

    but not everyone is a leader
    I met a girl
    and she just disappeared

At least this is how I've idealized this from reflecting over the past decade and the recent two years.

I don't think love is real. I've only felt other peoples' hatred, and I notice their affect display sensitively. Like when my family members look so mentally unstable with their stiff brow, glazed eyes and pursed lips, I know that there will be some form of abuse in order. I feel so much tension around people because I've only ever seen the underlying darkness in humans, even from ""loved ones."" So I fear my own human condition. I can't love myself because I know I'd be faking it, and I'd rather ""be me and genuine"" than be an animal trying it's hardest to find food any way possible. This is how I cope, in my own, elaborate intellectual and fantastical world where my human curiosity feels right at home. But I retreat from that... Because I was denied about my way of rumination. Reality just doesn't seem that real to me.

Years of this broke my soul and vessel down. I felt that my soul arduously enter a cave of darkness with a fear of light... It is afraid to present to others, connect with others, and it will defend itself by creating illusions through false stimuli of ecstasy. It shields itself with the vessel, but even that is just a container that'll allow the soul to spoil. The vessel becomes uglier, dirtier, and physically weak.

So we go deeper into the cave and over time we lose human conditioning. We do not react to the things the same way others do, and our soul therefore feels shame, and it is worried that it'll never fit in with the others again.

There is a point where we realize that we are in such pain that we yearn for contentedness. The cave is scary. But it's nearly impossible to see past it's complete darkness of depression... or the frightening sound of the shrieking bats of anxiety...

My rumination ended two years ago. I attempted suicide... hoping for the release of my soul. Nothing existed in the moment. ""Thankfully,"" I was saved by someone close to me at the time.

But I feel like I'm already dead.. My soul left me and rejoined the shadows on the cave wall. It has left this vessel. And for this. I feel empty.

No shred of existence.",BPD,t5_2qqdp,That feeling of emptiness [A bit sad... trigger?]

I am sorry. I just don’t know to who I should speak anymore, and I feel like this is what I was looking for: a semi-anonymously way to get things off my chest in hope of support or just a kind word.

Here I am, a 28-year-old male who had to move back in with his mom after 10 years of living on his own, because I was too lazy and just didn’t care about me anymore. Now I am sitting here, just not knowing what to do with my life anymore.

I have taken a risk and it hasn’t paid off. On the contrary, it led to me having accumulated debts of over 12,000 €, which I probably will never be able to fully pay back. Why would I even try anything else again? The last 18 months have proven to me that a risk will never pay off. This is the state of mind I am in.

I am diagnosed with Burnout depression. I am already on medication and in professional treatment. But still I feel it’s not helping. I’ve hit rock bottom so hard, it might have crushed my will to carry on. My mother is supporting in any way she can, but she suffers from cancer and has also to deal with her idiotic, cheating husband right now, a man who I start to resent just as much as my biological father.

I never had a male role model to look up to. My maternal grandfather died when I was 4, and I never had a close relationship to my paternal grandfather who died when I was 12. As silly as it may sound, I even tried to fill that void of a male role-model with the singer of my favorite band.

As far as girls and relationships go, I always seem to attract the ones who do me more harm than good. My first girlfriend suffered from severe social anxiety and depression. She managed to drive all of my friends away from me. I have by now fortunately reunited with the one person that meant the most to me.

That person is also a girl, and the first I had very strong feelings for. I thought she was my soulmate, and once I found the courage to tell her I fell in love with her, she said she likes me very much, but I am more like a big brother to her. That was the first time my heart broke. We’re friends now and I am over the feelings, but at that time, it hurt.

I was with my first g/f for over three years, although I felt more miserable as I saw all of my friends go away. But the fear of being lonely again was just so much stronger.

With my second girlfriend, it’s basically the same story. Depression and a bipolar disorder, but at least she had no problem with the new friends I made. But just like the first one, she cheated on me. And not only that, she basically admitted she only stayed with me for the last six months of our relationship because in that time, my maternal grandmother who I loved very deeply died. I was devastated not only by the loss of my grandmother but by that statement as well.

My latest relationship with my third girlfriend ended about a few weeks ago. It was just never meant to be, even though we were together one and a half years, but we are too different. She’s 11 years older than me, has a well-paid job and two kids and needs a strong man by her side who can give her security. Also, we had a long-distance relationship which she couldn’t bear anymore. We’re still friends (even friends with benefits), but it just hasn’t worked out in a relationship. Especially since she, too, suffers from depression, anxiety and low self-esteem. At least she didn’t cheat on me.

All these relationships have come because the girls have come to me. I am not saying I wasn’t interested in them, but the two times I have tried to make the first move on a girl, I was rejected. So, why should I even try to get into something?

All of my problems come down to this: Why even bother trying? It will fail anyways, because I am nothing but a screw-up who can never get anything right or can get good at anything. I am procrastinating things that are important. When I don’t feel good at a working place, I do a half-assed job, which then leads to me getting fired. I don’t even know what I am good at besides sitting in front of my computer, browsing the internet and getting fatter each day.

Where am I going with my life? I seriously don’t know. I know it has to come from inside of me, but right now, there’s nothing but a big, black void.

For anyone who read this: Thank you. ",depression,t5_2qqqf,I feel like I have hit rock bottom.

I don't get how people get any energy to do anything. I hear a jaunty song and for maybe a couple minutes I feel cheery enough to scroll a job search or make something to eat. Then boom minutes later-- go back to bed, dreams are far more interesting than anything I will ever attain.

I'll admit it, I'm kind of a ditz. I'm realizing all the people I'm instinctively drawn to--liberal arts types that like music, art, and literature a lot more than I do--kind of left me behind. The last time I felt I could navigate a few hours of conversation with was high school and one reunion dinner in college (happiest night in the last ten years...that group of friends is now gone and split up) and even then, I didn't (still don't) know how to dance. No experience with men, no teenage rebellion. No interest in the latter at the time, totally conscious then and even more so now. 

There's nothing I've done in the last two years that I want to talk about with another person, really, even reading a book for pleasure. No new hobbies. I made the huge mistake of graduate school because I couldn't find work, left without a degree because I thought about suicide constantly, fought with family, looked for work fruitlessly with a pitiful resume, done odd jobs and thanked Christ for the times I could just waste time reading movie reviews or something stupid...distract myself without being productive, away from family and out of my own brain.

That and ongoing shitty stamina made it easy to ditch two social events--one with friends in a bar (I hate, hate, hate sitting around and making small talk for two hours, even if I'm a good listener) and a birthday party for a friend I've ditched too often, but she wanted to go dancing. I don't blame her--it's fun, but I'm so uncomfortable in my own skin I feel like a jackass even bopping along to something in my bedroom. It's one of those things you need to pick up early in life or have natural talent for; for me, being on a dance floor is terrifying, not freeing. It's one in a series of regrets, because that's one easy social activity that doesn't require conversation as introduction. 

I feel like garbage and the thought of just looking for work after wasting the last two years in a grad school program that makes me furious to think about now, having nothing to show for something I never should have undertaken....Christ, I'm so fucking miserable and frightened about the future, and I've staggered around like a dumb animal with a head wound for the last four years, since college. That's the truth. I am a not a great liar, so it makes it unbearable being around friends, with my pockmarked, cyst-ridden face, pretending things are okay. Pretending I'm not humiliated by family that's ready to kick me out, terrified about maintaining health insurance, and ever being employed, even if I have to live with my family for another ten years and die without ever going on so much as a date. 

I can really see the rest of my life like this--using all my stamina for 12 hours of miserable work + commute in the sort of low-paying, low skill job that leaves someone open to abuse and quick firing, never making more than $30,000 in my whole life (if I'm lucky) while living with my parents until they die in a prohibitively costly city. 

I can't stand being around people as this person. 


I'm sorry if this is the wrong forum to post this in; I realize for many of you, you have made wise life decisions and social anxiety is something visceral, unpredictable, and torturously irrational. 

It might not be social anxiety, but I do know that seeing people--even when I can fake-smile and make phony small talk and LISTEN, which I'm decent at--makes me feel fucking empty and reminds me I missed out on so much, failed so much, am living a petty little life, and that the experience of either being around people or feeling any greater volume of sentiment that I have to when I'm alone, at peace, without an audience, is physically and emotionally exhausting--pulse-racing, lactic-acid-buildup exhausting. I feel worked up, agitated, and drained of life after seeing friends, especially those that are extroverted and have reason to be, because they're effectual people with some control over their lives, and their relationships. They've earned it, lucked into it, or both. 

I'm a bad fraud. Grin-pasted on my face, lying about who I am and how much I've fucked up--just a miserable fraud. Closeness is impossible under these circumstances, and I'm both lonely and hate being around people.

I don't currently have any friends, however I still live at home so I'm not totally isolated (parents +  2 brothers, whom I like well enough/spend some time with). I'm failing out of University for the second time in my life, this time because I got apathetic and honestly don't give two fucks so I stopped going to class/doing homework/writing tests. This means that I'm going to be forced out of University.

My parents don't know, and we have a pact that as long as I'm in school I can stay at home. However, I don't think I should try to go back to school in the fall if I'm just going to do the same thing over again. 

I don't have a job, lost the one I had 2 months ago. Sent out resumes to a bunch of places, mostly online - no responses. I've run out of money. I have an insurance bill coming up, my parents are going to have to pay. When they do, they'll find out that my $5000 loan has run dry. They'll be surprised, but hopefully I can keep why to myself (I bought a new PC with the money because I thought I'd still have a job to start paying the loan back).

If I can't get a job by the end of the summer, I'll be SOL. My parents will kick me out, and I won't have a car or a cent to my name. I'll have to live on the street most likely.

So with no friends, and family that now probably hates me for wasting so much of their time and money on a pointless endeavour (they pay for my gas/food while I'm ""at school"") - the best case scenario being I wind up with $25000+ of debt living on my own - what is there to live for?

I have no motivation to do anything, literally. I sit around and play video games (which I no longer enjoy, just for distraction) all day. I don't bother going out because I have no clue what I can do to make friends anymore. There are no meet-up groups around that I'm interested in, and I'm not exactly a partier.

I guess I should also add that I've never had a romantic relationship in my life, or anything that goes with that - not even a kiss. I've been online dating for 2 years, and been on 3 dates in that time (messaged 100+ women). I'm not attractive - in fact, I'm fairly unattractive to be honest. 6'0"", 300 pounds - no motivation to go out and do things, like I said, which includes working out/physical activity.

So, I'm stuck in this rut. No clue how my life could get any better at this point, with no friends, no job, no money and no motivation. To boot, my only goal in life was to start a family and with this much debt (and with the way I look), it's looking like an impossibility. Any suggestions?

Also, I've been being treated for depression for maybe 2 or so years now. I've tried CBT and a bunch of different anti-depressants (in combinations, and by themselves - on the suggestion of my GP as well as 2 different psychiatrists). Nothing has helped for more than a month. I'm currently not on any medication, as my last med set WAS working but started to wear off and I had side-effects so I stopped the dosage. My GP is at her wits' end, as nothing has worked so far. I've seen 2 psychiatrists, and 2 counsellors - none of which have helped thus far. The only psychiatrist left (around where I live) has a 2 year wait list, which I'm currently on. No idea what to do where treatment is concerned.

So I guess my question is, what has helped people here when they are at the lowest point? And I guess, suggestions on what to tell my parents about my money/schooling situation (as they don't currently know I'm failing/have no money). I'm honestly thinking about killing myself at some point this week, probably Tuesday as no one is around so I have a few hours to write a letter and figure out a way.

TheMicrocosm,,,1395109747,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/20opdm/they_probably_do_not_suspect_it_but_i_feel_the/,20opdm,True,2,False,1441865935,0,"Hello, r/depression. I've been lurking on Reddit for some time, and I've decided to make an account and ask for input on something.

I have had depression for quite a while, and although I cannot say exactly how long this is, I first began to identify it as depression about a year or so ago. It has fluctuated quite a bit in terms of its severity, but overall it's had quite a presence in me, whether I express it or not. That's essentially why I am posting this. There is a facade that I bear every single day... an upbeat, enthusiastic, (sometimes annoyingly) energetic demeanor, one that even deceives me at times, i.e. I'll convince myself that I'm ""happy,"" sufficiently complacent, and such for a while until my usual constant, critical introspection resumes (usually when I'm alone again). 

Many of those whom I'm around seem to assume that this is me, and while I don't know what they really think of me of course, they can't be blamed if they really think so. In reality, though, I'm introverted, somewhere between insecure and self-loathing, unhealthily preoccupied with what people think of me (this fluctuates a bit too, though), and would simply like to have a few close friends in whom I can truly confide and with whom I can have an actual, deep connection. 

Of those whom I'm around to whom I just referred, I mainly mean acquaintances whom I'm usually around, but as you may have inferred, I feel that the connection with them is really superficial. So, should I try to open up to some of the acquaintances who seem trustworthy and tell them I am depressive? Some things that have held me back from having already done so are (along with the fact that the way I often act around others now may make saying something serious like this seem out-of-character, dramatic, a plea for attention, or maybe even like a joke) the possibility that they may not understand, they may use it against me behind my back by telling other people that I just want attention or something, or they just might not care. Then, obviously, I still want to try, since it may help more than almost anything, and maybe I could find out who the true friends are, if anyone, by opening up. 

I really just want to feel close to someone who I know cares and knows what's truly going on with me behind the facade that I'm growing quite sick of feeling obligated to hide behind. Have any of you here who keep or had kept your depression ""low-profile"" ever tried to open up to friends, be they close or mere acquaintances, about what you're going through? If so, how did it go?

TL;DR: Often act happy-go-lucky, actually depressed, want to come out of the depression closet; should it be done even if it may polarize ""friends?"" Have you ever tried such a thing?

Thank you very much if you took the time to read this (sorry if it was convoluted, redundant, prolix) and if you have any helpful feedback. ",depression,t5_2qqqf,"They probably do not suspect it, but I feel the need to tell them."

I threw some rocks and was finally at ease. Until my mom texted me.
I just started taking prozac and xanax, I started taking them Saturday. I had a doctors appoint. last Monday,  she prescribed that to me. Before, I took lexapro, but it didn't help at all, so they told me to taper down by taking half a pill everyday until Saturday.
Well, my mom texted me saying she counted the pills; there are 23.There should be 27 (prozac) because I guess I was given 30 and since I started on Saturday, there should be 27, not 23. She started texting me, asking how much I have taken and what not, I told her I have taken ONLY the amount I was instructed to. I tried calling her numerous times, but she wouldn't answer until I texted her, telling her to pick up  the phone. I was a little hurt, her thinking I was abusing. First off- NO. I'm in the police explorers, I do great in school, I'll be in Spanish Honors Society, I have great friends, and would never, never, EVER do anything stupid like that. I was hurt. Yeah, I'm not close with my parents in the first place, but I thought she knew me well enough to know I wouldn't do that. Her even thinking that for a split SECOND made me wanna puke. I explain to her that I did not do that and that I was disappointed she would even THINK that. She apologizes and I go on my way home.
I get home to see my dad playing around with the garage code; he's changing the code, he tells me to go inside the garage and they explain to me they think my 21 year old sister (who DOESN'T LIVE WITH US) is stealing from us and took some pills. She has been having some problems lately, she was diagnosed with depression a year ago, she quit going to college so she could work and make up for some things. (She has had a few car accidents and needs to save up and what not.) That right there made me PISSED at my parents. I know my sister; she WOULD. NOT. DO. THAT. She doesn't abuse drugs, she is doing everything she can to get herself back up again, she is going on the right path. They ALWAYS talk about her and the mistakes she's made in front of me, it hurts me, but I can't imagine what my sister goes through. She is my sister, no one, not even my parents, can say anything like that. That's all I hear about from them, is how my sister screwed up her life. What they don't see is how hard she is trying. I'm proud of her. Depression sucks, they don't understand. My sister and I are the only ones in this damn family who can say anything.
I texted my sister once I got upstairs, I just texted hi to see what she would say. She responded that I probably won't ever see her again and that she didn't take my pills. She wasn't mad at me, but at my parents for blaming her. I replied back that I believe her and didn't believe for one second what my parents said to me. We kept texting, I told her how much I love her and miss her. We will hang out over spring break and possibly Thursday after school and once she's done with work.
What hurts the most is the fact that everything little thing that happens is blamed on my poor sister. I have been crying for the past three hours because of how angry I am at my parents. My dad was putting another flipping deadbolt on the doors and explained to me why; I did what I've never done before- I sternly told them how disappointed I was that they always blame things on my sister. I was mature about it, I didn't yell at them, I just told them. I went upstairs, still crying and angry. I took a shower and when I got out I saw my mom in my sister's old room. I said ""What are you doing now?"" I assumed she was looking for drugs, which she WOULDN'T FIND because I know my sister. She was just taking out some clothes I went in my room to feed my cat and my mom walked in to talk to me. I was sick and tired of them trying to get me to believe them (I didn't tell them anything about the texts between me and my sister) it makes me sick how they always do that, so I dead-out said ""How would you like it if your parents always blamed crap on your brothers in front of you when you KNOW they wouldn't do anything like that."" My mom replied ""I understand, but-"" Before I could hear anymore of that I just told her to get out. I'll admit, telling her to get out the way I did probably wasn't the most mature thing to do, but I've never done anything like that before and I just had to say something. The truth is, she doesn't understand, at ALL. Her parents NEVER talked lip about her brothers in front of her. I have one sister, one sibling, we are actually half-sisters (we're both bastard children one might say, because my mom wasn't married to either one of our dads when she had us. The dad I live with is my bio- dad, but not my sister's.) I always lose friends somehow, I either end up losing contact or they bully me, my sister is the only one I KNOW I can't lose because we are blood. But I was scared when I got that first text, because of my parents, I could have lost my sister. I have a test tomorrow in my favorite class (Spanish, I am VERY close with my teacher who is like family to me. I love her just as much as I do my sister.) I'm afraid I'm not ready for the test tomorrow because of all that's going on. I have studied before today, but I just can't focus and I know it's going to be a long night. I am thinking of emailing her about asking to take it another day, I know she would understand, but I don't know if I should do it; I'd feel kinda bad, I don't want my teacher to feel like I'm taking advantage or something like that, I just can't focus. This entire night all I've wished is for my teacher to be here with me right now, she really means a lot to me and helps me a lot.
I don't know what to do about anything right now, I'm tired, stressed, angry, upset, and just bleh. Sorry for such a wall of text, I just need some guidance right now. Thank you.

I spent 6 years thinking it could be depression, maybe bipolar, maybe nothing at all and I'm just an attention seeking crazy. This year, I started going to therapy and will be telling my psychiatrist that I'll try the antidepressants he thinks will help me. However, he has also referred me to get screened for DBT. I assume my therapist and he have discussed me, because I can't see how else he would make decisions on my therapy from the three 15 minute meetings I've had with him so far, haha. 

Anyway, I had a screening and the social worker thought I was an appropriate candidate for DBT. She also mentioned that people in DBT have BPD. I mean, I'm hardly going to know every abnormal mental condition that can ail the human mind, but I've never heard of this before. Growing up I've heard of schizophrenia, anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, whatever. But not BPD. I'll admit I'm sort of sheltered, but why hasn't it ever come up in my life before this? I watch some TV, I'm studying in a health related profession, I spend time on the internet. It's just weird. And I'm going to ask my psychiatrist and therapist if they believe I have BPD.

Also, I did a little quick browsing between studying for my mid exams, but there's so much negativity around BPD. I stumbled onto a forum with people advising someone to run far far away from a potential romantic interest with BPD. It's really disheartening. Apparently, DBT helps a lot, but I'm scared that it might not help me or that I won't be able to commit to it. Could anyone share their experiences with me?

**TL;DR**: I might have BPD, I've never heard of it before, but the ambulatory care hospital I go is trying to get me to be in DBT. Someone please talk to me about this.",BPD,t5_2qqdp,How common is BPD and why have I never heard of it before?

I'm frankly just tired of being alone. It's making me depressed and sucidal (relevant username). I've posted before under a different account, and I was hopeful since that post that things would get better. They haven't. I think about killing myself at least 4 times a day, and I've already planned 4 different methods with at least 2 failsafes each. I hate being alone. I miss having someone that I can spend time with and just love with every fiber of my being.

I have people that love me. Family and friends. I could tell them how I feel and they would want to help. They'd worry. But that's the thing. I don't want them to worry. I hate when people worry about me. And it sucks that they don't love me in the way that I need them to.

I get that I sound like some spoiled kid that wants some candy he can't have. I can't help who I am. Another issue with me is that I have committment issues. I can't stay with someone because I eventually start telling myself that I need to break up with the person. No reason at all. Just that I need to. I fight it off every now and again but I never win. It doesn't help that no one loves me enough to fight me about me breaking up with them. They just accept it and that's it. 

I don't know what's stopping me from doing it right now, but I'm going to do it soon.

Someone help me. Please.

I was considering logging in from my other account to comment on this, just so I could pretend that someone I know loves me enough to do so. I fucking hate myself.

It may be worth mentioning that I don't seem this way on the outside. From other people's point of view, I am happy with my life. I'm not. I've considered seing a therpist or psychologist because I also think I may be some sort of sociopath (may not be using the right term), but fuck someone knowing how I really feel AND knowing who I am. I do not want the two to be true for any one person except myself. Another reason I love the internet.

I just recently realized that I'm showing signs that fit pretty well into social anxiety but I don't know how to bring it up to anybody that could possibly actually diagnose/help. 

So basically I spend almost every single night alone in my room but because I'm very introverted so this never seemed unusual to me. What really made me notice is my complete avoidance of people I don't know and asking questions. Last year I didn't turn in the homework for the first 2 weeks of college because I was afraid to ask all these strangers how to work the printers. (I only figured it out because I watched one of my friends print something) On top of that, I always feel like I'm being judged and looked at. When talking to people I always worry about where my hands are or what I'm doing with my arms, how I'm standing/sitting etc. When I'm driving, I feel like people are constantly judging me and often times I'll take much longer ways to my destination just to avoid other drivers.

I'm currently a vocal performance major studying to perform Opera and the like. I have little trouble in performance but in rehearsal I always feel so awkward and like I'm being judged for everything I do.

2) Yes I do think about killing myself. But I'm not suicidal. There's a difference. I can think about murder and not be murderous.

I'm definitely in a low point right about now due to a number of factors (mostly loneliness). I can recognise that I'm about as low as I ever get because of a strange sick/empty feeling in the pit of my stomach (does anyone else get this?)

My point is, I have serious fantasies of dying in some uncontrollable manner such as getting hit by a bus/getting cancer/getting in a car crash or something similar. I feel utterly hopeless and like a worthless piece of junk and I want to die but I don't like the thought of doing it myself.

Drugs helped till about 2010. I was kicked out of one grad program (even after I made up the work/had a 2.94 GPA) and started another program in the same field when I realized I'd made a terrible mistake. Four years have passed since then. Being a fucking zombie idiot, I failed to look for work, which was my primary goal. 

Honestly, I've been borderline suicidal and getting increasingly worse despite staying on medication and seeing a psychiatrist since I was an undergraduate student (triggering circumstance 1). I am now an unemployed ""barnacle"" in my 20s and probably couldn't get a job flipping burgers (triggering circumstance 2).

I'm my own worst enemy as is--I'm unkempt, still living with adult acne, and look like a drug addict, despite my best efforts and getting 7 hours of sleep a day/bathing regularly. I'm foggy and have no useful skills. I can't really take being around people anymore if I have to engage them at length--I can fake it. 

I'll get to the gist--since 2010 with each episode, I have incredibly limited stamina with soreness in shoulders, lower bank, ankles, and headaches. They've gotten worse, and when it's at its worst, I can't stay upright. (Also, when I'm menstruating, admittedly, I'm suicidal for that 10 day chunk.) 

My mother triggers the worst episodes. I am beyond my own capacities to resist or reason her away at that time. Five minutes with makes me want to go to bed for an hour.  When she's lecturing me about being an ungrateful piece of garbage for not looking her in the face or working harder, I can feel my whole body throbbing/burning with sadness, or worse, rage, even if I manage to stay silent. She sees me closing my eyes because it feels like they're filled with sand, or my eyes welling, or gritting my teeth. I can't control it--I used to be able to, and can't anymore.

 When I'm talking to her, I feel like jumping out the window. (Not defending it--I mean that's the actual sensory experience, like I'm being burnt alive). I've made her suffer a lot; every time we talk about some horrible plan (""You're either in school, or working, so you better get a job), those places pound. I'm having problems with jaw clenching/teeth grinding, too.

It is not a choice. It is absolutely not a choice, I'm fucking ashamed of my life and this is the icing on the shit cake, because she won't back off and I can't move forward and repay her/relieve her anger and my defensiveness until I get a job, but the episodes are increasingly debilitating. So, frankly, is the thought of moving into a shelter. I could apply for low-income housing, maybe (I live in NYC), but given that I'm not working, I'm not even sure if I'm eligible. 

Coffee, carefully/sparingly used Ritalin, ibuprofen--worthless.

I will not get her off my back till I get a job, my resume is a fucking joke, and more than that, living with her (legitimate) anger and the shame of being so fucking helpless over myself is killing me. It's killing my father, too. 

What do you do when depression becomes unbearably physically painful? 

Here's what I have going for me, before you make suggestions: I am at least moderately active and eat grains/vegetables/get a decent among of nutrients. I get moderate sunlight every week. I'm not overweight. I take iron. I don't consume alcohol or recreational drugs. 

I hate being outside. 

I can't move forward with my life like this; the pain decreases when I'm not around her. It's there, but it's manageable.  

How do you regulate it, without being so doped up you can't work?

I'm a 35-year-old single guy from South Florida.  The last meaningful relationship I had was in my early twenties.  My three nephews who mean the world to me recently moved to Mississippi, a 16-hour drive away.  I lost my job in mid-January, and haven't been able to find a new one in my field.  I looked into filing a complaint regarding my termination, but I don't have the money to afford an attorney, and even if I did I'm not sure what good it would do to sue my former employer (or how it would look to prospective employers).  I'm 5'11"" and roughly 240 lbs.  I have random pains that really worry me (my neck and back are sore and lately my knees have been popping/cracking).  I stay up until 4:00AM every night laying in bed, trying to sleep but unable to because of my anxiety.  My parents (divorced for years now) are both struggling themselves, and I feel like a burden on them.  My grandmothers are both in their mid-eighties and have health issues.  My two best friends live hours away, and we rarely talk anymore.  I had a few coworkers who I considered friends, but since I lost my job I haven't heard much from any of them.  One coworker who I considered my closest friend down here recently met a guy, got engaged and pregnant, and for some reason removed me from Facebook.

I'm trying to stay positive and keep motivated.  I'm exercising, doing things at home that need to be done, trying to collect unemployment benefits (although the state is giving me a very hard time and I have yet to see a single cent from them).  I'm considering moving to MS to be closer to my nephews, but I'd be leaving my parents and grandmothers, so I'm torn on that.  They'll be back down here for two months in the summer, so I'm looking forward to that.

I guess I was laying here in bed thinking about all this and wanted to vent.  I have no one to vent to, so I figured I'd try Reddit.  I know I'm a big vortex of negativity right now.  Hope getting this out helps.",depression,t5_2qqqf,"Lonely, worried, and tired... (x-post from r/lonely)"

I don't have any real problems. By all account, I'm pretty lucky and doing fairly well. I'm a middle class british kid doing okay at a reasonably good university. I've not really experienced any hardship in life - my family life is all fine, although I don't speak to them as much as I should, and the most difficult thing I've had to go through is a few jokes about how I'm short and ginger, or always being last picked and ending up standing in the cold watching the people the teachers care about playing rugby. Perhaps losing my dog a few years ago.

Everywhere I turn, there's people who don't have it anything like as good as me. People who've been abused, had to survive on one meal a day, or people who've lost family members. There are people with life threatening illnesses, people who live under the threat of violence or people who don't have anything like the opportunities and advantages I have. I by no means think myself or anyone should have to suffer that stuff, but the fact that there are people who are and yet get by at least as well as me, or far better.

My course has very few contact hours (8-10 hours a week at most), and I don't really have any friends to see. There's a couple of people from my old school who I talk to occasionally, but for the most part the only thing I leave my room for is to go to lectures, or to buy food.  The rest of the time, I basically just crawl out of my bed and move all of about five feet to the desk chair, where I stare at my laptop until I have to do something else or I'm ready to go back to bed. I'm not doing the extra reading I should be, and sometimes I can't even bring myself to go to lectures. I find myself sitting here for hours, thinking I should be doing even basic things like taking my rubbish out or even opening the curtains. Sometimes I don't see sunlight for a whole day because I just have zero motivation to open my curtains beyond knowing that it's something normal people do. I barely eat hot meals, because anxiety means I'm so terrified of my own damn flatmates to go to the kitchen and actually cook something. I live mainly on a diet of supermarket meal deals and chocolate, and since I eat that in my room, the rubbish just piles up. I haven't taken anything out in almost a month and my desk is basically covered in crisp packets, empty coke bottles and sandwich packaging. Since lettuce/tomato in a supermarket chicken salad sandwich doesn't really count, the carton of orange juice I have next to me is the closest thing I've had to fruit or vegetables in a week. It's now two days old and probably not very good to drink anymore since it hasn't been refrigerated, and I only got through half of it - of course, I'll still assure my mother I'm getting my five a day.

All I really do is sit in the dark and stare a my laptop. Sometimes I'll play a game (although it's not powerful enough to run any of the hot new AAA games, so it's not like I even have much of that in common with anyone). Sometimes I'll stare at reddit or some other internet forum I stumbled across, maybe even get brave and leave a comment. Maybe even a youtube video at all, if I'm feeling like that level of interaction with the outside world. A lot of the time, on the other hand, I'll get done with the internet a couple of hours into the day, and sit there or return to bed and just do nothing, while thinking about all the stuff I could/should be doing and getting angry or upset that I'm not doing anything even though I know what to do, and that's going to lead to problems when all my grades get tallied up or I have to try and get a job while not having anything much significant on my resume. In short, I'm very uninteresting, and there's no real reason for anyone beyond my mum to care. I have nothing to talk to anyone about, so I just get awkward. That's why I'm literally scared of going to my shared kitchen. That's why I didn't go to the fresher's fair and pick up any clubs, and why I always just go to the empty row in a lecture and sit alone. If there's a break in a lecture, while everyone else is chatting with their friends and talking about x, y or z I'm sitting there scrolling reddit on my ipod (I don't have anyone to talk to so carrying a phone is pointless), looking for something, anything to distract me from how out of place I am in a hall full of happy, friendly people. The one thing I do sometimes do which can get me talking is doing my rubik's cube. If I can only find a relatively empty part of the room somewhere I wouldn't normally sit, someone might notice me fiddling with it and try to talk to me about it. That's when I actively start pushing people away - I'm not actually very good, there's people who can do it in 10 seconds and I stall around a minute. All I did was watch a few youtube videos and not have anything better to do with my lunchtimes at school than practice the one very basic method that doesn't require too much effort to learn. I have no friends here at university, and almost no-one from school. Even the people who add fucking everyone on facebook ignored me, and my best friend, in as much as I guess I have one by default of not having anyone else to talk to, is probably the weird guy who wants to join the catholic church, and he's got all his church group friends so even when I'm at home and close, he's hardly got much time for me. Every time I start thinking some of the other people I know are good friends, I remember all the stuff we don't do. How no-one ever told me they were going to see the hobbit in the cinema, or how I missed out on their various trips. They're travelling to see each other in their days off university, but no-one has even considered coming to see me in London, and because London is expensive to live in, I can't really afford to travel out to them without cutting into my food budget - although I guess other people manage to go out every week and still manage to eat, so that's my problem.

I just shut down over everything. I spent all tuesday thinking I should sign up for a mapping service because it takes a few days to go through and the coursework is due friday. Now it's thursday, and there's no way I'll get that part done in time. I'm basically fucked and I'll just have to hope that particular part of the assessment doesn't drop me enough to fail. And even though I signed up this morning, it won't work. I'm just sitting here, not doing the other bits I should be doing to get it ready, because I know I fucked up that one small thing and there's nothing I can do for that. I'm screwing myself.

In short, I have no friends, no motivation and feel like shit, and my only reasons are stupid and I know it. I know on some level that all this is my fault and there's no reason anyone else should care or change anything they might do to accommodate my shit. But I'm lucky. There are people with real problems out there that have a very real impact on their future. They have the ""right,"" and I know it's shitty of me to think of it that way, to feel bad. I don't deserve to go see the student counselling services, despite my tutor saying I should when I nearly broke down in a meeting over nothing - I thought I was going to miss a piece of work I then proceeded to get in on time. There's so much shit in this world, and just because I'm not actually depriving orphans by throwing food away doesn't mean I can't hog resources someone else needs more than me. I'm not even sure I should be posting here. I'm among people with real reasons to feel awful, while I haven't got any diagnosis of an actual anxiety or depression issue so I'm basically just some kid who doesn't deserve anyone's help, and hasn't got any real backing beyond a nebulous ""feeling awful"" for any kind of cry for attention.

I really hate myself for that. More than anything else, I don't have my occasional breakdowns because I'm scared of the consequences of not eating a hot meal in a month or handing in some coursework a day late. I have them because I caused those problems. It's my fault. I'm just a useless fucking waste of space. I don't know why I can't go and cook myself some pasta. That's why I was crying on the floor last week. I can live with not eating the bloody pasta, but I'm not sure I can live with knowing I can't and there's no real reason for that. I'm screwing myself harder and harder all the time, and it's all going to crash sooner or later, but until then all I can do is sit here numbly trying to ignore the fact that I'm fucked, it's all my fault and I don't deserve anyone's help. 

tl;dr: I'm a useless waste of space. I don't deserve my advantages, and I don't deserve any help or attention for my disadvantages. Fuck me. 

I don't even really know why I bothered typing this.

Throughout Tuesday I had been thinking of a sort-of ex of mine (we were FWB for a year, and we stopped seeing each other in December), and I was enraged at myself for thinking of him. I even got to a point where I broke down and sobbed in my boyfriend's arms for thirty minutes. I wept about how he'd always been faithful to me from the very start of our relationship and how I haven't been (about a month into our relationship, I messed around with the ex-FWB but he forgave me) and how I wished I could be more like him and not make him second-guess the state of our relationship a lot. He just comforted me and tried to console me as best he could without breaking down himself.
For the rest of the day, I felt better, but I also felt incredibly weak for breaking down like that. I hated myself for losing it like that and I hated that I even brought it up.

Ever since then, I've been finding it really hard to feel any emotions. I just feel weary of everything. My lack of emotions has been hard on my boyfriend, and we've been fighting so much because of it. In fact, just today we were texting (in school) and he sent me: ""I can't handle you when you're like this. It's pretty clear you don't care about me or anything during these times."" and I just sat there, still emotionless. I wanted to compel myself to cry, but I just couldn't feel the sadness. After class ended, he tried to meet up with me where we always do/did, but I didn't look at him; I felt rage - not legitimate feeling-it, but I really wanted to feel it. He hugged me, and I just kept thinking, ""Why the fuck are you doing this. Leave.""

I earnestly do love my (ex?)boyfriend; he's so kind and understanding and faithful. But from the beginning of our relationship, I warned him of my depressional episodes and how they made everyone angry at me for being depressed. I told him that I will drive him away. And I was right. I fucking drove him away...

Anyways, I've just reached a point where I can't feel any sort of emotions. I want to cut and stab myself, but there's no rage. I want to cry until I can't breathe, but there's no sadness. I'm just a black hole of emotions.

The reason I believe I have BPD is because, even though I have chronic depression, I've never been completely dead to emotions.
I'm quick to anger, and it's always been intense anger, to the point where I want to punch my wall until my knuckles bleed.
I've been so scared that I'll lose friendships with my guy friends that I will sext with them, despite my hate for it and feeling like a whore, in desperation to keep them. And most of those guys were complete sleazebags to begin with..
I've always had a terrible self-image. I think of myself as a worthless whore who shouldn't have any sort of companionship. The other day, my boyfriend was telling me how smart and beautiful and amazing I was and I just scoffed and shrugged at it all.

I know doing this over reddit isn't really good for diagnosis, but I'm starting to get scared (if I could feel it). I'm scared that there's something more wrong with me than there already is (the depression). I'm scared that I'm going to completely lose my boyfriend. I don't want to lose him at all. I want to just hold him and cry in his arms and tell me it will be okay even though I doubt it will..

We've met years ago, everything was cool, but after my first breakdown, they began to use me. I always drove them home. I always was there, when they had problems. But if I needed them, they just didn't care about me or my problems. November/December 2013 I was in a mental hospital to get my stability and make the first steps in life. They didn't text or visit me once. That made me sad. Now in January I began to let the contact get lost a bit. Today on of them asked me, why I don't come along anymore etc. and that they're sad. I told her that I don't want to be friends anymore because of reasons. I did not tell her because I was afraid. Now I have a bad concious and freak out because I think that everything way my fault. But it isn't and I know it. But my head says: Apologize, although I don't want them to be my friends. I cannot understand, why I feel bad about my decision.

I would brag to all my friends! ""My daddy is keeping us safe in the army."" ""My daddy is super strong so he can catch bad guys."" Etc! You left just before I went into kindergarten.. You were gone for three super fucking long years. I barely ever got to talk to you, and that part I understand for the most part. You'd send me letters, and god fucking damn it I kept every last one.
When you came home, for good, you were different... You were changed, and I can't explain how but you weren't my dad.. You made me do these horrible things for hours and hours and fucking hours. I'd fucking get breaks but otherwise if I did one single thing wrong I'd be in lots of trouble. I'd have to stand there with my arms straight out to my sides, for however long you said.
Eventually, you stopped with the horrible arm things.
Then, you started to hit me, my brothers, and my stepmom at times. I'd go to school, and whenever it my week with you, I'd try to get to my moms house. You are always in my nightmares now.
I'd have to show the nurse bruises all the time. Nobody fucking believed me except for the nurse.. She called some people and a horrible, bitter old lady came to my dads house to check it out. My dad was always aware the visits were coming somehow. He'd make me clean the house from top to bottom. Every single room and all.
This went on and on, from the time I was eight until I was 14, when I left to get help. I was gone for 10 months to get out-of-home treatment for all the things you did to me to make me so fucked in the head. You never tried to contact me, not once. I had to call you. I don't know I ever did. It would have saved me a lot of time to leave you out of my life. You're a fucking asshole, and you manipulate me and everyone around you.
I love you, because of the person you used to be, but I hate you so much for all that you've become. It makes me wonder if I'll become like you.. If I'll ever become a failure, a monster..

Of all the people in my school, there was probably only about 8 people anyone would have predicted a brighter future for. But here I am. I no longer want to exist. I no longer wish to do anything. I just sit and pray to the fucking air that I'll go to town one day and meet someone that sees something in me, I get some sort of sweet deal, and live happily the fuck ever after, or not at all. I wish to do things that I never practiced for in my lifetime. Be a youtube comedian, be a dolphin trainer, be a singer, scuba diver. And I now hate everything that I grew up wanting to do, like sciences and programming.

I've known about my depression since I was about 12. It was quite mild, and probably honestly still is compared to some of you out there. I'm 18, going 19 this year now. In the last year and a half my depression has really flared up. I can't have a single solitary moment without thinking of some way in which my life could fail or has failed. It almost felt like I had reined it in this past month until yesterday, when I went and saw dolphins for the first time in my life. You see, this past month I thought I had committed to attempting the YouTube comedian schtick. Well, this just in from my brain: You should totally go back to trying to get into dolphin trainer/caretaker. And I would like to. I would also like to be a singer. Or a YT comedian. But guess what? I am not that funny. I have an average singing voice. Extremely low levels of creativity, because I always focused on sciences in school. I also can't swim well, because I was forced out of swimming lessons when I didn't breathe properly in front crawl (I failed 3 times for the same reason). 

I will NEVER go back to working in a min. wage restaurant, grocery, or other generic job. I snap way too easily for those. I fear that if I don't make a decision, AND ACTUALLY ACT ON IT AND SUCCEED, I am going to end up killing myself in some darkened alleyway in Canada next winter. I could care less about the effect it has on my family. If what I feel for them isn't hate, it's damn close. 

I am afraid of my mind. I am afraid of my future. I hate who I am, with my laziness and indecision. I want a future that I can be happy with, that can drown out the constant stream of doubt and antagonism of my mind. But the only thing I seem able to do is ask, ""Why me?""

It's going to be pretty disjointed because it's 4 AM here and I'm writing this on my phone. I feel like a scumbag. I feel like an idiot for not seeing it sooner.

I want a girlfriend pretty badly. Have for a while. I thought I was just lonely.

But if I'm completely honest, that's not why. I want a girlfriend because I have crippling self esteem issues.

I wouldn't have even noticed if not for another pathetic thing I did. I started writing a fake relationship advice request. I don't know why, I just started to. I suppose I hoped making it up would be a suitable replacement. Maybe getting responses from /r/relationship_advice would make it seem more real. Anyway, this is it:

>Let me start off by saying I had a pretty lonely childhood. Apart from my parents, I could never interact with many people because I lived out in the country and I was an only child. My parents love me, but I never feel it. It's a very distant love. Real, but obligatory and impersonal. They've got their own shit to deal with, and I respect that.

>So today, when my girlfriend looked into my eyes and told me she loved me, I kind of lost it. All those emotions I bottled up over the years, all the happy tears I never let myself cry, came out. It was an entirely different aspect to love. She CHOSE to tell me that, she CHOSE to stay with me. Despite all the shitty days, despite the fact that I seem aloof or emotionally cold most of the time, she loves me bec

That's real up until the second paragraph. After that it's all fantasy.

It's beating a dead horse, I guess, but I really, really do not like myself. I'm a failure, yeah, and I make stupid decisions, yeah, but it's deeper than that. I hated myself even when things were looking up, even when I was the model student. And I don't know why. I can't put my finger on it, I just take it as an axiom: I am worth less than other people. It can't be reasoned with or argued away. And I don't think it'll ever leave. I can't ever be proud of my own achievements. It's never enough. So then I give up. Well, I gave up.

Right, so anyway I've come to the conclusion that I don't want a girlfriend because I'm lonely. At least not primarily. I only want her for validation, to prove that yes, someone can tell me ""I love you"" and mean it, that yes, I'm worth loving by choice.

I want to feel that. I want to feel that so badly. And I want to reciprocate it. But knowing that the only real reason I want a relationship is for selfish ends, it feels like I shouldn't have one. Like it's creepy and wrong.

A lot of my life revolves around trying not to seem creepy. I judge myself all the time, I overanalyze everything. Oh no, I said this, what if she thinks I meant it in this way, or oh no, I haven't let him talk in a long time, what if he's bored? What if I'm being *that guy* and don't realize it?

With doctors, with acquaintances I know I don't have enough in common with and am too withdrawn/immature a person to really befriend...if I engage, I end up hurt. 

It's easier being alone. I wish I could explain this to my psychiatrist--I can't tell if he thinks I'm an introvert, or sick, but the truth is, it's truly harder in life being an introvert, especially if you know why you find it easier keeping to yourself. 

With each attempt to force myself into becoming a person I'd like...it's too hard. It doesn't work. There is no way to read what I should have, listen to the music I should have, look the way I think I should to feel equal to my peers, and look for work. And try to manage mental health. I need 40 hours a day. 

One errand outside the house every day--4 hours--and that's it, I'm punch-drunk for the rest of the day. I'm too tired to make a phone call to a friend or anything else by then.

Knowing how fucking difficult it is just watching other 20-somethings or couples, reading (other) community blogs about people's lives, jobs, relationships...whatever exclusion or longing I felt to be another person before has been horribly sharpened by the internet for the last ten years. 

It's just an awful way to live. It's awful feeling like one brings hurt or fear on themselves, just by their nature--knowing your personal best, kindest, smartest, whatever, isn't really worth anything at all, that it's a fluke in the landscape of awkwardness, professional failure, social failure, ditziness, mental fogginess, shelteredness. It's horrible figuring out you're nothing but a burden and desperately wanting to be alone and to feel nothing. Even the psychiatrist feels like another judge, not an ally. 

Sorry to ramble, I had to put that somewhere. The attempts just to reach out, demonstrate interest or affection for people, as is--without waiting for some supposed ""perfect moment"" or actualization of self--are so frequently excruciatingly painful. 

I feel like I'm being cosmically punished for something and the penalties get worse for not taking a hint and just giving up.

She said it was so I could see what grown-ups looked like. I was too young to know whether what happened to me was wrong or not. But in retrospect I do wonder what effect it had on my emotional development.

At age eight, a different female babysitter would strip my clothes off in front of my younger brother and lock me outside the door of my own house - in broad daylight. I know for a fact that it had a profound negative effect on my emotionally. Considering some of the previous trauma I had experienced before when I was younger, my emotional state was already pretty fragile to begin with. My brother told our parents what had happened and for the rest of summer, a girl from our church would babysit us. Because the now-former sitter lived just down the street from us, every now she would pass by on her bicycle and hurl insults at me if I was playing in my front lawn. Again, I didn't know what I had done to make her angry at me, but I stopped playing in the front yard from then on out.

At age 18, my parents had the opportunity to move out to Eastern Washington, an area I detested (and still do). I was bound and determined to stay in the Portland area and the woman I was dating (who was 9 years my senior) offered to take me in. Almost immediately after my parents had moved away my girlfriend would start emotionally and physically abusing me. Anything would set her off, and when she got angry, it was my fault. At one point she threw a full-sized box spring down a flight of stairs at me. All throughout her tirades she would rail on about how she had been physically abused as a child, and later would be in abusive relationships (that also ended up exposing her daughter to sexual abuse as well). I had no intention of hurting her or her daughter, but the only way I could demonstrate my honesty was to let myself be subjected to abuse.

Eventually our relationship would devolve to the point where the only kind of physical affection I could get out of her was in some form of abuse or neglect. Her idea of sex was to have me help her masturbate to climax, after which she would turn over and fall asleep. Any time I asked for some kind of physical interaction, I would be told that I was constantly asking for sex.

After three years of constant debasement, I came to the realization that I had the resources at my disposal to leave that relationship and I quickly did so.

This is the first time I've actually opened up about my past history in a public forum. One of the reasons I've been reluctant to do so is because whenever I mention being abused or molested to someone individually, the reaction is invariably one of the following:

""You were too young to have it do anything damaging to you.""

""Don't think that by making shit up you've had the same abuse happen to you.""

Or my favorite:

""But you're a guy, didn't you like it?""

It's the same dismissive attitude that people reserve for other victims of sexual assault and rape. I always take the subject of rape seriously and refuse to joke about it. But I won't have someone tell me that being coerced to touch a woman's genitals at a young age should be a positive experience. I also fail to see how it makes any difference that the person throwing insults, punches, and sometimes furniture at me was my girlfriend, and not my mother or other authority figure. What further rankles is how often I've been subjected to emotional and physical abuse at the hands of those who themselves have been abused and are blind to the circle of violence and loathing that they are now making themselves party to.

I'm not posting this for any kind of attention - positive or negative. I'm also not here to make some kind of misogynist statement about the iniquity of the female gender. If anything, what my experiences have taught me is that you don't need a Y chromosome to be a maladjusted prick. But I can no longer keep this inside me any longer and feel that only by bringing this vein of darkness to the fucking light I can find a way of working with it.

Having said that, if you think that disregarding my experiences outright is going to suddenly undo them and make me shut up, you've got another fucking thing coming.",survivorsofabuse,t5_2t3ms,"""But you're a guy..."""

Stuck in basically the middle of nowhere with a bunch of other students, a bar and nowhere to hide. It was great. I was spending every day with cool people, and we got to sit around drinking and chatting in the evenings. I'm honestly not sure I've been that happy in years.

Now it's over though. I'm back at home, no-one to talk to and nothing to do. I haven't talked to anyone else apart from to mumble thanks to  a guy at the supermarket checkout since Friday. Now we're back, all those people I had with are no longer stuck with me. They're back in range of their friends, good phone signal and an internet connection. Sure, it was fun, but they probably didn't actually really appreciate my being there. It's certainly dumb, but I can't bring myself to even send some of the people I talked to a whole bunch facebook requests. I can't even send a bloody facebook message to these people because I feel like I'm worthless and no-one should have to have anything to do with me.

I had all those feelings before, but now it's worse. On some level, I know there are people who seem to be, at the very least, not opposed to my presence. I've remembered what it feels like to talk to people and have fun and even have friends. I've talked about my issues leaving school and losing my friends from there, and someone raised the ""it's better to have loved and lost than never have loved at all"" thing. But I'm not really sure. I was sort of okay with my misery before. Now I know what I'm missing, and it feels even worse. Maybe that will pass. Worse, this is probably an opportunity. I hung out with people, I could continue to do so. But I haven't taken the initiative, because I can't bring myself to. 

I think knowing that even after I've sort of found what I want, I still can't force myself to get out of this situation is the worst thing. It's another level of blaming myself, and another turn in that awful downwards spiral of hating yourself for your own thoughts, and then hating that hatred.

When I'm at home, all i can think about is how lonely I am.  When I leave the house to go try and have some fun, all I can think of is how I'll be alone for the rest of my life.  All I want is someone (or more) to spend time with, and have fun, but I'm such a piece of shit that I won't let anyone close to me.  Why would I? It's about the only considerate thing I can do.  Why would I let someone get close to me when all I want to do is die, and I'll just be dragging them down too?

It's getting harder and harder to make myself take care of myself.  I'm up to about once every four days for showering.  I haven't had a haircut in over a year.  I only end up shaving every month and a half.  I don't get around to emptying my cat's litter box nearly as often as I need to.  I'm too lazy to take out the trash regularly; it's not spilling out of the bin or stinking or anything, but I probably should have taken it outside a few weeks ago.  Instead, I just mash it down as best as possible.  And cleaning? HA! I con't remember the last time I ran the vacuum.

I'm fat, and lazy.  I eat too much.  I eat only crap (not literally). And my eating schedule is almost completely opposite of what a healthy one should be.  I know how to eat healthily.  I know that I need to eat less. I know all that crap, I just can't get myself to do any of it.  Meanwhile, I get out of breath just walking up a flight of stairs.  Hell, sometimes it doesn't even take stairs, sometimes just walking out to my car is all it takes. I haven't done anything workout-related in at least a year, that includes just taking a 15 minute walk. My 3XL shirts are pretty close to being too short.  Hell, a lot of times lately I've even passed on jerking off because it takes too much effort.

I've been taking meds for depression for several years now, and they just don't seem to keep working.  They'll kind of work for a bit, but eventually, it's back to square one.  Lately, there seems to be some anxiety building up too.  I have trouble making myself do stuff.  For example, it's a chore to get myself to get out of bed.  It's a chore to get myself to leave the car when I get where I'm going.  Usually, all I want to do is go home and crawl in bed.

I know of all sorts of things that I should do that should make my life better. Most of them should even be simple, yet, I'm too much of an asshole to be able to do any of them.  All I can do is complain-- complain and hate life. I'm a piece of shit.  I don't even deserve the oxygen I breath.

I called my psychiatrist and his staff told me to just stop taking it and wait for the next appointment.

It's been two weeks, and this is the fourth session of class I've missed this time, probably the eighth or so this semester.

I dropped all my other classes, so this is my only class right now. Why is it so fucking hard for me to just nut up and go to class? It's Econ 101 for Christ's sake, I could do it in my sleep. I could bitch about how my professor never puts anything on Blackboard, but that's just shifting blame. I'm sitting in the parking lot *right now,* so why the **fuck** didn't I just go inside and sit down? I got this far, why can't I just walk the final hundred feet?

This semester was supposed to be easy classes so I could ease back into school. Apparently I've turned into an idiot and a coward and I don't see how I can recover. The school's going to terminate me after this semester because of all the classes I've dropped. I could appeal, but my parents are probably going to kick me out after they find out I completely failed *another* semester.

I thought I'd never have to come back to this place in my head again, but suicide is looking pretty good right now. I'm not facing an existential threat here, it's not like I'm going to suffer horribly. I could probably get an unskilled job and make rent if I live with a couple of roommates. I'd survive.

But it's abundantly clear now that I'll never really amount to anything. Success is probably out of reach.

My life is not going according to plan and I have absolutely no idea how to even start making a recovery.

It's not going to be today, or probably tomorrow. But at the end of the semester? When my savings account finally runs dry? I don't think I can bear to fail so miserably yet again. I'm too weak.

So I'm having what I'd classify as mild suicidal thoughts, but I can't tell *anyone*, because I've already lied to all the people I'm supposed to be confiding in and letting the facade slip might be the thing that sets off the serious thoughts. I don't want to die, but I don't think I can handle living like this for much longer.

Edit: After getting that out, I think I feel okay. It's almost annoying, these little outbursts of actual emotion are so short. Crying felt good.

I am 23 years old (turning 24 this year). I have had clinical depression for a decade now. 

I wonder how I am still alive sometimes, how I manage to not just kill myself already. Though I have made attempts on my life in the past, and I've self-harmed and even be hospitalized.

I've been medicated, done therapy.  

I'm about to graduate undergrad (after 5 years) in a month. I should be proud of myself and patting myself on the back, but instead I'm looking at all the things that I failed to do, or didn't do great on.

Right now my GPA is an exact 3.0, which in this time and age, will be very hard for me to get into graduate school with (if I don't change my mind about going).

I am a psychology major, and I wanted to go to graduate school for clinical psychology and ultimately be a clinical therapist. Because I know the pain of suffering from mental illness, and I want to help others who feel just the same. 

However I have moments where I have intense doubt. I'm still fighting myself. How can I help others if I can't even defeat my own demons? Then the thought of  7+ more years of school kills me a little inside.

I struggled with undergrad, and I'm surprised I made it (hopefully, well I already have my cap and gown, can't return that). But there was so much struggle of balancing work and school, getting sleep, trying to complete assignments when my mind was foggy or all I wanted to do was cry. 

I haven't had the time these past 5 years to focus on my health. Instead, it's been deteriorating even more. People have said to me, ""If you take a break from school, it'll be harder to go back."" 
Well, I know that if I don't, I will only get worse, so I plan on taking time off until  I can handle my depression better to go back to school.
Hopefully it won't be too long. Only a year, but like I said before, I probably don't have enough experience and a high enough GPA to get into grad school.

That's disappointing.

On Saturday, I went to my hairdresser for my appointment. I wore a dress, and felt nice about having the time to put on makeup and put slight effort in my appearance since I never have the time to with school and work.

Of course all that was shot once I sit in the chair and my hairdresser asks about my weight. She has done this before, and I just subtly nod and murmur that ""Yes, I have gained weight.""

At my smallest I was 120. Now I'm a total of 160, which is borderline overweight for my BMI index.
A lot of my clothes are old, high school old, and don't fit me properly anymore. It's embarrassing, and I'm ashamed.

Even when I went to the clinic and got weighed, the nurse commented and asked if I was okay.

Honestly, I find it rude to point out a person's weight like that. I just wish they would shut up. 

When I got to campus Monday and got out of my friend's van, I  had failed to notice the rip that formed near the crotch of my pants.

1 pair of wearable pants down, 2 to go. I remembered what my hair dresser said Saturday and got even more upset.

I have a lot of trouble with people socially. I'm very awkward, and don't know what to say a lot of the time and can't relate. I can appear cold and standoffish.

I went to the wrong university. I didn't have much help in the decision 5 years ago, and didn't really know what I was doing, so I ended up at a university where I don't really fit in. The majority of my campus are beautiful feminine sorority girls and jock guys in fraternities. 

Now I blame myself. I should have tried harder to fit in. I did make attempts, but gave up after I felt I wasn't getting anywhere. I blame myself for being ""different"". I'm into the goth subculture, not only that, but I'm a goth of color, so I'm pretty much in a small number of those that exist.  (Only one on my campus. My campus is small.)

Why couldn't I just fit more into society? I can't help what I like, but I hate myself for it all the same. It gets lonely.

I had deleted my Facebook because it got me more depressed to see my old high school friends hang out together. That I wasn't invited. That my social anxiety prevents me from asking them to hang out. I was off it for about a year and made a new one about 2 months ago. Once again, those feelings of isolation are bubbling to the surface, and I realize it's probably too late to establish a close relationship with them.  I hate myself for it. 

I do have someone, my boyfriend who is also gothic. However it is a long distance relationship, separated by coasts, and everyday I am afraid of him finally saying the distance is too much and breaking up with me.
Or because he's fallen out of love with me.
Or because he finds me boring.
This fear of losing him is so intense it's annoying. I literally stare at my phone waiting for his replies, and start internally freaking out when it's been a while. I think to myself, ""Oh God, here it comes..."" and breathe a sigh of relief when it's a heartfelt message instead. 
Why can't I just enjoy the relationship for what it is? I just want to stop worrying over things I can't control. I'm so worried of saying the one wrong thing that will make me turn away from me. 

I wanted to move after I graduate and be with him and in the area he lives in. I visited during my winter break and absolutely fell in love with the area (Seattle).

I have 7 grand in my savings account that I want to use to help me get there. However he lives with his father and he said no to me moving in. I respect that decision, but it still hurts none the less.
I tried to meet people on craigslist and such, but that didn't work either. People either didn't reply or would stop replying to me.
No one wants to give space to someone without a job, even if they have money saved up. It makes things that much harder. 

So I'm staying on the east coast for longer than I wanted to, but it was either do that or have to move to Texas, and I know I would be unhappy in Texas.

I don't have a license, or a car, so I can't really do much outside of my roommates choose to drive. I feel like a loser, because pretty much everyone on my campus can drive and has a car that their parents brought, or were hand-me-downs.

If I were able to get out of the apartment more, it would probably help, but I'm stuck between work (which is on campus), classes, and my apartment down the street. 

I feel pathetic.
The fact that I've had depression for a decade now and still haven't beat it yet? 
Once I graduate my on-campus job will be over, so I have to look for a new job that will last me 2 months before I move to the northern part of the state with one of my current roommates. 

I just really want a pet. Preferably a dog. I've never had a pet in my life. But I just want that unconditional love from a canine right now.

I'm just so fucking frustrated with myself because it's been a decade of depression and spending the past 5 years at a university I was unhappy with. When the fuck am I'm going to be happy? I don't want to waste any more time being sad. I can't help but think about the peace death would bring me.

It just comes across looking creepy and desperate :/ it's a vicious cycle. no one talks to me because of my face/I don't smile/I get more depressed/I get more alone/I frown more.. and the circle loops again.

To add more background to my social dysfunction, I had a period in high school (beginning of junior year, to be exact, age 17) where my anxiety got out of control and I skipped enough school to warrant being kicked out and forced to homeschool. My parents didn't teach me, I had a teacher I met with once a week.. but that doesn't change the isolation element. I had to do this all the way until graduation. So I didn't even get to have the social ties from high school and the high school experience. On top of that, the 2 years after high school and before college (the ""Ross"" phase), included an abusive relationship that went on for over a year, which isolated me even further. I wasn't ""allowed"" to talk to any other guys, and I was manipulated into spending lots of money on this douche, plus he lived in my house (my parents' house) while verbally/sexually abusing and controlling me. 

Now, entering college, I feel like I'm eons behind everyone. It feels like I stepped out of a cave after 4 long years, and not in a good way. It's like I'm so far behind in life stages that I'll never be able to relate to anyone. In high school I had a few relationships and my confidence built once I got the ball rolling, it was easy to meet people through acquaintances and such, but here I know literally no one. It's hard to meet people when you don't already have friends. Plus, I'm way old for a college girl. I'll be 22 this summer. Guys scoff at me and girls brush me off and make fun of me. I've been taunted and shot down more than you can imagine. I feel like I'm constantly running into a brick wall only to get up, try again and smack it again face-first, only harder. My life feels like a giant catch-22, and it's destroying me inside.",socialanxiety,t5_2r22n,Feeling out of place and ignored at college

But nobody would've ever known because he's kind of that cheerful kind of dumb guy, (I know this isn't an act because ive known him for most his life and he's always been like this.)

He's always been a somewhat strange kid constantly getting into fights and making irrational decisions and always seemed to enjoy watching conflict between his friends.

The thing is that I feel he's partly doing it for the attention...
Now /r/depression here me out...

I've had another friend who was depressed and the way she dealt with it was that she kept it a secret and only told her close friends about it, she would wear long sleeves in public and etc.

I always assumed that this was how people dealt with cutting and depression.

But instead this guy goes around telling me in the most CASUAL way possible. Like ""Hey! throwaway, Im cutting!""
and changed his skype mood message to 'scars' after I told him he'll get scars which he'll later regret.
He's also gone around somewhat bragging about the amount of alcohol he has and sometimes tells us how 'drunk' he is.


Maybe people just deal with cutting differently but I found it somewhat strange (he lives in a different country so theres no way to be sure he really does cut either) that he would act so casual about it like it was a joke.

PS: were both 17 and I've never had to deal with a lot of depression myself which is why it's kind of hard for me to empathise. 

So any kind of advice/explanation on why my friend acts this way would be nice or if it really is strange.

* Money
I barley have enough to pay the rent this month and our Water, Gas and Electricity bills have not been paid. I don’t know what to do but it’s stressing me the fuck out.

* My Body
I look in the mirror and hate who is looking back. My shoulders are too wide, my legs are too big, my arms are too built up, my feet are old mans feet, my leg is covered in scars, my jawline is too male, my arms are too hairy and so on and so forth.

I have been on medication over a month to treat my depression. The first few weeks were alright. I had a few happy moments and I had fewer times where I retreated into a dark place.

However, the past two weeks have been difficult. I've continued to do activities such as exercising and eating healthier, but I've been experiencing really bad mood swings. I had mood swings before I took medication, but these seem to be more severe and my family is in agreement with me. The mood swings range from numb and apathetic to bawling and scared. When my family member brought these mood swings to my attention, I started to keep a journal chronicling my feelings everyday. I thought it would be helpful to show the doctor, but I don't know if that'll help. 

I just wanted to know if anyone else experienced mood swings while taking anti-depression medication and what you did to take care of it. I know changing medication or stopping medication are options. I'm really scared to stop  medication, though.

I'm just not really sure what a doctor can do for me. Maybe a diagnosis can help as a confirmation that I don't actually suck, I just tell myself I do, but I don't know. 

Every feeling I get, I understand exactly how wrong it is. I know people aren't really judging me because I'm sitting alone. It just feels like I'm trapped in a bubble whenever I'm around people.

It all started 5 years ago. My freshman year of high school, during an in-class project I sat in a spot so that a very pretty girl was on my right and my best friend was on my left. Me and my friend were exchanging telling jokes to try to make the girl like us. It seemed to me that she smiled and laughed at most of mine, but I was optimistic back then. We didn't talk at all, I just told jokes and she laughed occasionally.

A week later, she moved schools and I almost never saw her again. I say ""almost never"" because I did see her at a Sears one time my senior year of high school, but she didn't see me. I kind of tried to avoid her seeing me, I don't know why. I also saw her when we took our SATs; we were in the same room to take it because our last names are somewhat close alphabetically. She never acknowledged that I was there then, so I assumed that she had forgotten me. After all, we were only in one class together and we never talked, if I was her I would've forgotten me too.

My junior year of high school, I had this dream. I dreamed that I was with her. As in, boyfriend and girlfriend. We were just holding hands and it was perfect. No sex, no heavy petting, just holding hands. It was the happiest moment of my life...until I woke up. Then I cried out of self pity for not having been in a romantic relationship with any girl ever. To this day I have never kissed a girl or had a girlfriend ever.

Fast forward to a month ago and I'm a depressed young man who wants to kill himself. I'm visiting my cousin and aunt in LA and my cousin doesn't talk to me, barely even looks at me. She calls some guy friend of hers ""cuz"" and doesn't even talk to her real ""cuz"". She got a 2000 on the SAT, I got a 1950. She's going to college and performing in shows, and I'm taking a year off of school to wallow in my own fat, tears, and self pity.

So here I am, digging my sunglasses' temple tips into my wrist because I want to die and I hear the song ""Mr. Brightside"" by The Killers. I remember a post of hers on Facebook that said something like ""Nothing better than singing at the top of my lungs to 'Mr. Brightside'"". So I go ""what the hell"" and message this girl I have never talked to and only really interacted with 5 years ago. Here's how some of the conversation went so you will understand my problem:

>Me: Hi. You probably don't remember me, we were in the same bio class one year. Anyway, how are you doing? I know this is kinda strange that someone you don't know is messaging you, so I would totally understand if you didn't respond. I'm just looking for new people to talk to.

>Her: Hey! I remember you, no worries :) I'm okay! How are you? :)

And so on and so forth. We talked about school and the crappy wedding she was at with her boyfriend and then had fun posting different Facebook stickers. It was awesome. She remembered me! But then I lied and said I needed to go, I don't know why.

Anyways, now it's today. We're friends now, or so she says. She tells me personal stuff about herself and I've told her about my depression. I think I might have started having feelings for her.  I know if I start liking this girl it's going to be the same thing that's always happened to me: rejection. Especially because she has a boyfriend. She hasn't talked to me in a week. I've sent like 5 messages to her, all not replied to. My last one: ""I know my last text said i was gonna stop, but in all honesty, I like talking to you. You're just really nice and just talking to you sometimes makes me feel better. Just wanted to let you know that. :) "" I don't know if I can handle this...I don't know what to do.",depression,t5_2qqqf,About a girl

My dad still hates J. because he broke up with me for weed. I think they knew something was wrong, and I really wish they had said something. But now I know I can't start healing completely until I tell them what the relationship was really like.

Guy she married seems like a really good guy and everything and I am really happy for them.  However, the more I think (which tends to get me into trouble mentally) the more I become saddened at a few things.  The first being that I am not really close with my sister and this weeding was the only time that I have visited her (she lives about 12 hours away).  My other sister has visited her several times and hell even my wife has been out to visit more and they aren't even that close.   

I am also really bothered by the things that not only she has experienced like going out of the country (call it jealousy I guess) but just the places that her and her husband have been to and been a part of.  I don't feel like my wife and I have experienced that much comparatively and it makes me question how much are we missing out.  I am almost 30 and my wife is 28 and we have no kids and I want to take this time to go out and see places or do things before it becomes more difficult whenever we do have kids.  

The last thing i've been thinking about has been the lack of friends and the lack of effort each of us has made to try to remedy it.  My wife seems pretty content with where we are and I have talked with her about my thoughts on the situation and nothing has really changed.  I saw how many friends my sister and her husband had that came from literally around the world and it just really hit me hard.

I am 25, married.  I'm not broke, I have minimal student loans to repay, and I have a job.  I also have an objectively adorable dog.   I have no reasons to be sad, yet here I am, chronically depressed and reaching out on reddit.  This baffles me.  I thought that if I got my life in order, if I just achieved some goals and had supportive people around and took care of myself, the depression would go away.  Instead, I'm just running around frantically to maintain my semblance of a good life so that people can't see that inside I am failing; inside I just want to die in my sleep. 

I feel as if I have no right to be depressed, that I've failed as a human for being so un-resilient.  I did come from a difficult family situation, and I did get abused as a child and I did try to kill myself in college.  You would think that my life now would point to some kind of recovery.  At least now, I can *seem* like I am normal.  I'm a well-adjusted young adult to anyone who hears about me.  I came from difficult circumstances, but hey, things worked out.  It got better.  Right?     

Yesterday after another day crying at work and ignoring the ""kill yourself"" impulses on the commute home, I drank a bottle of nyquil in some kind of gesture to myself - ""look at me, I have officially stopped giving a fuck"".  But I woke up in bed.  That moment of waking up, not knowing where I was or what had happened in the last 12 hours, was the most positive I've felt in months.  It was weird.  I should have felt embarrassed, like this was just proof of my failure.  But I just felt like I had reset myself, through the headache and fog of overdose.

Nothing is fun. I'm surrounded by people talking and laughing and smiling and I'm here, all alone, doing nothing. Apart from going to the fridge or the loo, the only reason I get out of bed most days is some vague sense of obligation, like the day is somehow even more wasted if I lie in bed instead of sitting staring at my laptop, at my desk, three feet from my bed. Occasionally I have to go to an exam, or to the shops. In a month or so, I'll be going home, where I'll have to walk the dog and empty the dishwasher. 

Then it's summer. Three months, alone, with nothing to do. Nothing to enjoy. There's little enough here, at university. All I have here is occasionally seeing one of my flatmates in the kitchen. I say ""hi"" and move on. Sometimes, I have to go to the library and get out a book to pretend I'm revising. I might even see someone from my course there. ""Hi."" But in summer? Nothing. Sure, my parents and my brother and my dog will be there. But they're my family. It's nice to have them, but it's not a substitute for friends. People I can talk to and have fun with. I can eat a meal with my parents and ask how their day was but that's it.

After summer, who knows? Maybe, despite my almost total lack of preparation, I'll have done well enough to be allowed back into university. Probably not. I've already all but failed some of it. Either way, it's not like I have anywhere to live. No-one would want someone so uninteresting with them. Whatever happens, I'm fucked. If I'm kicked out, that's £17,000 in debt for exactly no gain. I'll be at home, having to explain to my parents why despite supposedly being pretty clever, I couldn't even last a fairly easy year of university. Why that debt is there. There'll be a lot of explanations and arguments, but at least I'll have a home. If I stay, more debt. Also, I'll be homeless, still miserable. Then again, if I'm back in London, at least I'd be around someone. 

At home, in the middle of nowhere, there's literally no hope. I can't drive. No friends or even much work anywhere near. We're not on a bus route, nowhere near a train station, and I can't drive. Apart from my bike, I'm entirely dependent on my family for basically everything that can't be accomplished from my bedroom. In London, it's a little less dire on that front. Physically, I'm nearer to everything I might need. Mentally, I'm a billion miles away. I've been living in this flat a year and I still don't know what courses half my flatmates are on. I can't bring myself to call the university residences department and ask if there's any chance they've got any suggestion so I can have a roof rather than a box behind Tesco. I'm supposed to get 100 hours work experience this year, according to the careers department. I'll get 0.

There's no hope. No friends, no hope of friends. No hobbies, no hope of hobbies. I just sit here, doing nothing, and it will stay that way. I'm a waste of resources. All the food I'm eating, the electricity I'm using, the money I'm costing, even the carbon atoms that make up my body, are being wasted. I'm worthless, and everything I do could be invested in someone so much better. It's all going to backfire horribly somehow, and my life will go from boring and wasted to genuinely horrible. Even if it won't backfire, I think it will. If nothing else, those thoughts are causing the backfire. The anxiety, the thoughts of worthlessness, are causing

It's frustrating, being stuck here. I know I needn't be miserable. I know this is wrong. There's nothing to be scared of in phoning the residences department. Sometimes I'm too scared of my flatmates and their friends to go to the kitchen and make myself a meal. What the fuck is wrong with me? I'm worthless, and even more than I hate that, I hate that I know it and still do nothing. Like some sort of downwards hate spiral. As much as anything else, I hate myself for the act of hating myself, and then I hate myself for that.

There's no future for me. No hope of it getting any better. It's just going to keep getting worse until I die. Anything is better than that. Maybe I should just die now, but I'm too fucking scared to. It would take a second, to grab my oyster card and wander to the tube station. Test the current running through the tracks. I vaguely remember hearing 1000 volts, although that's probably bullshit. It'd be enough though. If the electricity doesn't manage it, there are trains every few mines to finish the job. I won't do that. I have to do something, but I'm too scared, so I'm just going to sit here until someone forces me to do something. There's a decent chance that something won't be what they want me to do. I can't handle people needing something of me, even if it's for my  benefit. I'm going to run out of excuses that work for other people long before I run out of excuses that work for myself, or at least whichever idiot part of the brain is convinced some nebulous horror is always going to happen at every reasonable little thing. If only the reasonable part of my brain was in control, everything would be fine.

You think but you never do. You lie in bed and you stare at screens all day, watching other people do things with their lives while you can't be bothered doing simple tasks. 

You watch other people live their lives while you waste away yours.

Your life is shit and you do nothing about it. You don't finish anything. You're a quitter. And that is why you're where you're at! And you're going to stay there if you don't do anything about it and the situation is only going to get worse.

Wake up in the morning and DO SOMETHING! Do your daily tasks that you HAVE to do instead of watching TV or playing games. Because after that film finishes and that game ends those jobs are still there and they always will be! The longer you leave them the more of a chore they become and the less you want to do them and you waste your day and you feel shit because of it.

WAKE UP.

START LIVING YOUR OWN LIFE AND STOP WATCHING OTHERS!

APPRECIATE WHAT YOU HAVE NOW AND SEIZE OPPORTUNITIES INSTEAD OF LETTING THEM PASS BY.

THE ONLY TIME THAT TRULY EXISTS IS THE PRESENT. FORGET AND LEARN FROM THE PAST, YOU CAN'T CHANGE IT.

I don't want to spiral back-down into it. I study Sociology at Uni, I've got less than a couple of months before I finish my Bachelors, it's another year for my honors which might give me some research skills so I'm not completely useless... but I feel like I'm trapped, useless and hopeless. I try to speak to my family about my thoughts, but they can't emphasize with how I see things because they haven't studied Sociology and seen how messed up things are. Have you ever seen the film The Matrix? I feel like they're asleep, plugged-in to the matrix. I'm telling them that there's that there's (social) structures and dynamics that are pulling the strings, that influence the way we think, but they don't believe me, they can't step-out and see why there's all these problems. People just assume the problem is *you*, because that's the easiest thing to do in the situation. No one has the power to change these structures that are now ingrained, brainwashed into all of us, so it's just easier to give-in and fall asleep.

I feel useless because I'll have a degree that shows I can think critically about society, institutions and group dynamics, but I'll have no practical skills whatsoever. In contemporary society the world revolves around making money and business but I have nothing to offer to businesses, only critiques. The world I live in seems like one big playhouse with our vocations, silly play money and man-made importance. It seems like our lives constantly revolve around consumerism, buying shit we don't need but we're told that we do. Lives revolve around working 9-5 or longer each day, in and out, going home, eating, maybe playing some video games, watch some television.

I feel guilty because I've had better opportunities than a lot of unfortunate people, like I have a responsibility to make changes, but I don't know how.

After studying this I feel if I go into the workforce I'll work in a monotonous job that will crush any creativity and life I have in me, if I can get a job at-all. It seems like all jobs are commercial, service jobs, or business jobs. Standardization. Our lives revolve around efficiency, minimal human-error. Competition. I can't work in a job I have no passion about, go home and follow the same routine 5-6 days a week and watch my life waste-away while the only relief is cheap, easy-entertainment that perpetuates this very system I've learned is so flawed and humanity destroying... 

But I know if I don't conform I will end up on the street. I feel like I need solidarity and a means to shape my environment for the better of everyone, but I feel like I lack the means to do so and I'm fighting against the tide.

I just got out of a mental hospital for depression, anxiety, alcohol abuse, and suicidal thoughts. I'm on new medicine and I was feeling much better, until this afternoon. 


Please stay with me. This has a point. I got home from school and was making myself some food. I had actually had a fairly good week, for once. Testing is over, and my grades are rocketing up. My brother asks to use my laptop. I say he may. I ask what he wants it for and he says he needs to print something. Now, our printer has not worked in a long time. It does not work, and he knows this. He asks if he can still try, and I say no, because it is pointless and the printer is not physically capable of printing. He keeps insisting on using it and tells me I'm being selfish, even though I'm saying he can use it, as long as he doesn't print. He is mildly irritated and begins to pout. I offer to make him food, he refuses. I offer to try and find another way to entertain him, he refuses. I was trying really hard to be nice, because I had had a great day. 


10 minutes or so pass and he's mostly over it. He's still begging, but not mad. He's finishing homework and accidentally cut himself on something. He asked me to help him get something to help. I say that I really can't because the medicine cabinet is locked. 


He looks at me and says the most hurtful words I've ever fucking heard, *""God. I can't even go into the cabinet to get a Band-Aid and it's all because of you.""*


I just stood there in shock. He is 11, but he knows what I'm going through. He was talked to about how serious my condition was and to be careful of what is said. He knows that my parents now keep the medicine cabinet locked because I may kill myself. He knows I was in a hospital. He knows it all and still said that to me. In those few seconds, I went from having a great few days, to terrible. My own brother said this to me. 


He doesn't give a shit that I want to die so long as he gets a Band-Aid. On top of all this, it is the weekend of my motherfucking BIRTHDAY. Not only did he want to hurt me so much over a cabinet lock, he decided the weekend of my birthday, a month after I was released from a hospital, would be a good time.


He hasn't even apologized once, either. I just stared at him with an open-mouthed stare of disbelief, anger, sadness, and betrayal. He doesn't care at all. He's always been very self-centered, but this was just kicking me in the groin. I feel like utter shit. I'm not allowed to take an Aspirin by myself because I may chug the whole bottle and he sees this as fair game. It's now 5 in the morning, the day before my birthday, and I don't feel any happiness at all. 


Happy fucking birthday to me, I guess.

I kept my mouth shut because to tell you the truth- I almost killed myself last year. But Ms W unknowingly saved my life by showing she cared. I almost did it but she saved me.

To after 49 days I relapsed. I have never before counted days like this, I always just stopped because I was feeling good enough, with the nagging knowledge that I would relapse eventually when the pain got to be too much, but until then I would do everything I could to fight it. This time was different, it felt so much more final. So on bad days I started counting all the days I'd been clean, anything to show how strong I'd been and that I could make it. I'm going off to college in the fall and feel that I need to have at the very least control before then.
So I counted. To reiterate, I never count, not even through trying to clean up for the first boy I ever loved (with his amazing support). I have always just lost track of cutting until it found me again.
Today was supposed to be my 50th day and I can't even say how much that would have meant. Instead, all the shitty feelings of disinterest in the world, worthlessness, emptiness, emotion pain, etc. were swirling around in me when I accidentally scraped my shin on my friends car seat. The resulting big bleeding scrape sent my over the edge. During the rest of school I was nearly hyperventilation with need or about ready to collapse with the exhaustive strain of trying to function beyond the negative emotions and need to cut. When I got home I ended the tallies I had been making for clean days and took a pair of scissor to my hip, 1 cut where no one would see, then I would stop.
I needed more. Three tiny cuts to the ankle I sprained a couple months ago and can cover with my ankle brace during pointe/ballet class or any other time someone's likely to be noticing my ankles.
I needed more still. 1 cut to the outside of my right knee, small and slanted so that it looked like I clumsily brushed by something and got a scrape.
Still I needed more. 1 cut on the outside of the left forearm, achieving a similar accidental look.
Then I had to go to school function for my upcoming graduation.
I lingered and talked with friends and felt like an outsider, entirely to guilty with the band-aids I'd hastily slapped over my cut, but afraid of what would happen when I was alone again.
What happened was a cut on the wrist, just one long one that can be hidden with hair ties, and another cut to the hip. I hopped in the shower to douse them with scalding water and head off anymore cuts. Then it all came crashing down on me.
The idea of the sophomores in my flute section ever finding out about my cutting. The girls I had practically raised these past two years, who still seemed like innocent freshmen to me. Or the girls I tutor, only is 6th grade and so trusting. The very idea of any of them seeing this horrible horrible habit. I broke down, sobbing, mouth forced open by what must have been a silent scream. The pain was so much more than the normal guilt and shame that has followed my relapses before. I stopped the shower, unable to do anything more than sob. I actually made myself sick with the pain, crying, and panicking, barely making it to the toilet in time and eventually lapsing into dry heaves. When the tears, panic, and blind terror finally subsided, I resumed the shower, only to begin hyperventilating when I once again realised my control was slipping and i may really need help. I couldn't breathe, my legs gave out, and then I couldn't even sit. I tried to regulate my breathing but I just fell in on myself. Too weak to move to do anything even as tears came fast and hard. In the end my vision went out but consciousness remained as I worked up to breathing once more, then sitting, them making it out of the shower and collapsing on my bed. The pain in my chest sharper and deeper than relapse has ever been.
Then I turned to here, because it hurts too much not to write.

No matter what, and im a guy with pretty strong aspirations, I pretty consistently feel like theres no chance I will ever be a functional independent human being, that I will never fall in love because all people do is use others, that evben if I graduate college, there will be no job for me and I will always be a Walmart Sales Associate, community college attending basement dweller.

Another thing is, ive fallen in love which is both wonderful and terrible. She really is everything special to me and we are even talking about getting married someday (im 19 and shes 16). Still, this is in and of itself terrifying because she has so much destructive potential that all the guys I slept with casually in the past (im bi) didnt have and this really freaks me out. Im prepared to admit that I do get pretty posessed by jealousy at times and no mater what I feel like having been raped more or less defines me as a useless man with nothing I can be other than a semi functioning victim of others douchebaggery",ptsd,t5_2qm0x,"That sense of ""limited future"" that got mentioned in the NIMH brochure, does anybody else get that?

I'm sick of making mistakes, I'm sick of being forgetful, I'm sick of being ridiculously unorganised, I'm sick of having a shit memory,  I'm sick of fucking up. I'm just sick of being me.
I have always been like this. Ever since I was little I have had an extraordinary talent for doing or saying the wrong fucking thing. 
I've been told multiple times that ""it's not gonna always be like this"", ""you can change if your really want to"", ""it's gonna get better"". Well it fucking hasn't. I know I can change, but there's some things you just can't. It's like trying to change your sense of humour. For the past few years I've been trying to change to be a better person to the point where I've became so self aware and self conscious of what I'm doing and what I'm saying and how it may effect other people that I've managed to somehow get social anxiety to the point where I'm secretly a nervous wreck inside. 
And if I try and stop my initial response to things happening (which will probably be something stupid) and what people say the moment passes to say what I wanted or do what I wanted and I just do nothing. But sometimes when my instinct takes over I do something without thinking and fuck something up. There's no middle ground. It's either do nothing or fuck up, and both are as depressing as each other. 
And everything is just piling up inside and sometimes i think that I'd like to be able to kill myself. Just to fucking leave it, to stop being me, to stop this pathetic self loathing, to stop all this shit, to not have to be on my own with only my thoughts as company and screens to stare at.
 I can't be bothered. I'm sick of wanting to be liked, I'm sick of caring of what other people think of me, I'm sick of being insecure and I'm sick of not being able to talk to anyone about this. As soon as you even bring up the topic of thinking of suicide you get told that's the cowards way out and how selfish it is to think like that and that makes me feel so much better doesn't it?
I'm sick of my insecurities, I feel pathetic and if I talk to anyone they just sympathise with me, and feel sorry for me and give me compliments on how much they like me, and I'm thankful that they think that of me but I'm sick of being so insecure and pathetic that I need to actually fucking hear people tell me that. I'm sick of over analysing every thing I say and other people say to the point where I take myself away from the actual conversation. I hate the way I can't seem to stand up for myself and let people walk over me. I'm sick of being overly sensitive and easily hurt and upset, but the worst thing of all is that I'm sick of hiding behind a face that makes it look like everything's alright. Because it really isn't and I just really need to speak to someone about this without being judged and without my friends or family perceiving me in a different way, without them feeling they have to look after me and having to be responsible for me.

So I define myself as having chronic depression (I'm aware of the dangers of self-diagnosing and that's not what I'm trying to do, I'm just using that as the best term available to describe how I feel, to better communicate what I feel inside to you guys).

Most people don't notice my depression since I'm fairly quiet and introverted and am always telling jokes and making people laugh when I *do* talk.

Just need somewhere to get this all out and journals don't work for me so here goes.


I've had many problems throughout my life which don't really mean much individually but come 2 years ago I first attempted suicide because everything was too much. I was made to go see a school counselor because I was so down the year before but we just bounced around unimportant topics as I have maaaajor trust issues due to childhood stuff. So I stopped seeing the counselor and life went on until the attempt.

People noticed at school a drop in my marks (again) and I was asked what was wrong when I broke down about my home situation and a trigger from 'friends' that led to the attempt.
As I never mentioned just *how* bad I was feeling to the point of wanting to take my life, nothing came of this either. Just the typical 'it's hormones' so I put it down to that, too.

As I went throughout the year it got worse again but I held off until January of last year with attempt number 2. I just felt so down for no reason to the point of taking my life. Unlike the year before, nothing triggered me to feel this way that I can recall. I put it down to hormones again and knew there must be something wrong with me but my mum hates me (so I thought) so why would she care if I want to die? I'd be doing her a favour.

This was the start of my last year of high school. 


It actually started really well in February. I had thought I had gotten over the hump so to speak and got a few good marks, was studying what I wanted to. Then the work got harder. There was more of it. Assignments stacked up. No time for myself. Lose touch with my two friends - one of whom moved state and the other left school to work full time. Everything was piling up again.

My irritability and sadness was rubbing off even more on those around me causing more abandonment and frustration all around me. Home life went from shit to shitter and when I attempted to make friends nobody wanted the sad-koodies. By the middle of the year I was ready to take my life.

One girl, H, noticed how lonely I was and we started talking and I realised it would be better to go sooner rather than later so I don't hurt her if she cares anyway. I tell her what I'm going to do - on my birthday - and am dragged to the school counselor again.

My birthday was ruined as I'm forced to tell everything because otherwise they would be required to call my mum. We made a deal, though, that because of my history at home, my mum would not be called as long as I promised to stay safe. Yeah, right.

A week later trying to separate myself from H, she notices I'm not improving and I know she cares so instead of making attempt 3, I began to self harm.

The self harming wasn't sever per se but was certainly necessary to bandage and I was worried about infection so I went to the school first aid and asked for bandages but was questioned and it came out that I had been self harming. A few counselor trips later and it's only getting worse.

He is forced to call mum as I am causing physical harm to myself and mum is just in shock. She cared about me all along. But she's still angry at me. The mixture of every emotion blows me over the top and attempt number 3 occurs. 

I'm landed in hospital and sent to the psychiatric ward for a little over a week which showed mum does care but I still feel shit. I'm diagnosed with depression and anxiety, both severe, and begin my lab rat medication testing.

**WHO**: I'm a young guy, 25, reasonably athletic, love to listen to music, riding my bike is probably my favorite thing to do. I've struggled with who I am since I was 18. Used cannabis as a coping mechanism for the past 3 years though quit last summer. I recently did quite well in school for the past term B+ average - highest I've ever obtained and have been in school for years now - still officially in 2nd year and have 30K in debt. Summer school is currently tenuous/stressful.  
  
**WHAT**: I am posting because I feel like life is always a struggle where I have to make the right decision every time all of the time in order to progress. This leaves no room for impulsiveness. This recently came to a head when I tried to make love to a gorgeous woman but could not perform. This could have been due to cycling (it has recorded negative impacts on erectile function) and I have since purchased a different saddle which may alleviate the problems.  
  
**WHY**: I think I need a degree of impulsiveness in order to be myself. The issue is - it's a slippery slope for me. I feel like I need to make the right decision ALL of the time or else my life just doesn't even matter. Giving it 100% or as close as possible is the only acceptable choice in my mind. I constantly monitor my thoughts (meditate regularly) in order to make sure that I am positive, commanding, etc. as I want to be many different things  
1) A great lover  
2) A great triathlete  
3) Be debt free and be able to do things I actually want to do (bike around the world, go sky diving, run across Africa, make love to many people around the world)  
  
**HOW**: I got here because it seems difficult for me to balance life.  
  
**WHEN**: I'm going to get a psych eval by the end of the month but I've been to many professionals and they all just say I think too much - if it's impeding my abilities to function then ... it's an issue, no?  
  
OH, the only time I feel good about myself is when I am giving 100% to the goals outlined above and am completely and utterly exhausted and can give no more and then just lay in bed listening to music - any other time it feels like my internal dialogue is saying... you need to do more, you need to do more, you need to be more, keep on going. The only thing is - I FIND IT SOOOO exhausting. Hence why I started weed initially. 
  
  
**The bottom line** - has anyone struggled with making the right decision all of the time and how did they balance their life while satisfying that part of their brain which always wants more, more (and honestly gets bored a lot)?   
  
  
**Update**: So - I had ADHD - meds are working awesome. Boom!

I've got three and a half months of nothing. At least, while I'm here at uni, I'm around people and there's potentially help available if I can force myself to go to student advice/counselling services. At home, I have none of that. I don't really have friends I talk to much anyway, and I thought that sucked, spending most of my time sitting alone for the past year. Now I'm wishing I could keep doing this. At least there are other people around here. Once I go home, there's just my family. 

I'll go from sort of having friends to being basically alone. I've got my dog and my parents and my brother at home, but that's it. They're not really ""friends."" They're not my age, and I feel like they'd probably not really give a damn if I wasn't family. There's nothing wrong with them, but they're not a replacement for actual friends, really. I only had a few friends from school, and even then I'm still caught by the feeling that they were really just tolerating me out of pity or something. Whether they'd want to see me again or not, I live in the middle of nowhere, don't drive and there's not even a convenient bus or train to take me anywhere near them.

The other thing which sort of kept me going was that student support was there. I never got over my anxiety issues to actually call them, but they were there. At home, the doctor is miles away, again with no good way of getting to it. Plus, my GP is a neighbour/family friend, so I really don't think I can bring myself to see them, patient confidentiality stuff or not. 

Months, with no friends, no hope of friends, no help with my issues and no hope of help. If I'm resorting to self harm and giving up on myself already with those vague distant hopes here, what am I supposed to do without them? 

Even after summer, I've got so many problems I've got to deal with somehow to prevent the coming disaster that is my life.

I expect each day to be better than the last, although I refuse to believe karma is real. If it were, I wouldn’t be this miserable. The victim should be allowed to ride into the sunset. We should be allowed to witness karma at work. Instead, at least in my case, the days have gotten more tiring. I’ve gotten weary, trying to act as if everything’s ok. Some mistake this for the whole “Being strong” idea, where I have something to appear strong for. I don’t. I have to act as if I’m content with everything because I’ve already appeared more weak in front of others than I’d like to admit.

Ever since I lost the love of someone held close to me many months ago, I swore that it was just one of those things that I’d get over. I felt like I would be able to move on, as most people would. I’m barely 22, still young, with many years of the limelight waiting for me. I feel like I couldn’t be more wrong. Because of my mistake of not trying to repair things, I fear I threw away my true other half. Nothing has been getting better. I admitted to my mistake and that’s all I could do. I have to live with the results.

Now my thoughts have been plagued over what I should have done, or what I didn’t do correctly. I’m stuck analyzing our whole 3 years together, trying to find where it started falling apart. I’m stuck analyzing my life as it is now, feeling miserable while watching you being happy. I’m trying to do anything I can to take the next chapter of my life but I’m still stuck on this page. Because of this, any kind of romance or relationship I see is a trigger. I feel entirely hopeless because I might have thrown away my only chance at something like that because I was young, scared and stupid. I didn’t know what I had.

The part that really breaks my heart is that if I get that chance again, I’ll probably revert to being blind and clueless. I’ll probably ruin it again.

I posted a thread here awhile back, most of you recommended I get help. So I scheduled an appointment with my doctor to get a referral for a psychiatrist that would be a good fit for me. I've been preparing for the possibility of being prescribed antidepressants (I'm more than open to psychotherapy but that hasn't worked at all in the past). I wanted to ask: would being on antidepressants help improve my performance in college? I've noticed that ever since I've been depressed I've been doing poorly in school. I mean, I'm an extremely intelligent person, but often I just don't care to do my work, which in my math-heavy major means that my phoning it in doesn't work for very long and eventually I succumb to poor grades. I have to focus really hard and fight to do any work out of class, to the point where my brain feels like it's going to explode because I just don't want to do it. I just want to stop and just do nothing forever. The same goes for my hobbies, I can't practice music or write stories or anything, and those are things that I *love* too. I know it sounds like I'm just being lazy, but I'm not, I'm just not motivated. I've heard that sort of stuff can be related to depression, so is that something antidepressants could fix?",depression,t5_2qqqf,Question about antidepressants.

I had some ups during that time, but they didn't happen very often, and when they did, it usually felt like they were just bringing me to the water's surface for a short time before I would sink back down even lower. 


I was diagnosed with major recurring depression; I was constantly thinking about suicide, I was admitted to the psych ward multiple times for suicidal ideation and once for an attempt, and I basically made life miserable for myself for over 4 years.
I still feel down sometimes, but now that I'm past the worst of  it I've noticed that I very often have trouble staying focused, or I forget things very easily or they slip my mind until after it's too late, and I feel like I've sometimes lost my common sense and my ability to solve easy problems. It's a very alarming thing to witness happening to myself; I'm a 28 year old man and I feel like my mind is already going downhill.


I know that depression negatively affects memory, concentration, etc., but I don't know how long-- are the negative effects of depression permanent? Long term? Fully recoverable? Whatever the answer is, how exactly does that process work, and if it isn't permanent(which I'm hoping/thinking is the case), then what can I do to try and reverse the occasional feeling that I'm going senile at 28?",depression,t5_2qqqf,Does depression have long-term negative effects on memory?

I put most people in my life into two categories. The first category is the ""They like me"" category. The second category is the ""They don't like me category"". If they are in the first category, I am very happy to see them and be around them. I feel comfortable around them, and I feel like I can be myself around them. 

If they are in the ""They don't like me"" category, then I feel uncomfortable around them and I get tense. I am constantly on edge around these people, and trying hard to please them. For example, some of my coworkers are in the ""They don't like me"" category. When I work with them, I always offer to do some of their work so that I can please them.

***Here is the problem:*** almost EVERYONE ends up in the ""They don't like me"" category. For some reason, I always find one little thing that makes me thing they don't like me. For example, one of my coworkers wasn't talking much to me. I immediately thought ""okay, she doesn't like me"". But then later on, I overheard her telling another coworker that she has a bad headache and isn't feeling well. Then I felt really stupid for assuming that her quiet behavior was because of me, because it was actually due to her headache! 

This thing is really stressing me out. I have therapy appointment later on today, and will be discussing this with my therapist. I am also starting DBT soon. I am hoping I can learn some skills to change my thought process. But for now, I am wondering if anyone else does this thing too? Do any of you place people in categories like I do? Has anyone found a way to stop doing this?",BPD,t5_2qqdp,I've noticed a pattern in my behavior: I label people. Does anyone else do this?

My friend (let's call him Tom) is one of my only *true* friends, and as a result I cling to him like a small child to a parent.

Why isn't he talking to me? 

It's quickly followed by a sense of dread/sadness - he's not my friend, he's just been using me, he wouldn't care if I dropped dead. 

Then the anger comes. This shit is just high-octane, molten magma, all-caps hell. HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO ME? HOW COULD YOU LEAVE ME FOR THAT SCUM OVER THERE? WITHOUT YOU, I AM NOTHING. YOU MOTHERFUCKER, KILL ME. KILL. ME.

After the pain you’ve dealt me, I grasped onto my anger because I felt like I had nothing left to hold. I used my resentment and bitterness to try and make me continue. It’s been deadly. I don’t want to “win you back” by any means. Our bridge is burnt. A card laid is a card played. But we had so much history together. Burning a bridge is never that easy. There’s still the burden of memory and reminiscence.
 
We both threw each other away, in the most visceral way possible, and scurried to try and move on as fast as possible. I left the country, and you started seeing someone else just as quickly. Initially I thought it was some way for you to get revenge on me, like you wanted to twist the metaphorical blade in my metaphorical wound. What I didn’t consider is that maybe, just maybe, we were never meant to be, but you and him *are*. I have always compared my progress to the progress of others, and judge myself (too harshly) on how those two juxtapose.

 I’m still lonely. I still want to punch my concrete wall until I bleed, and I still want to lie down and waste away until I die. Sadly, it’s never that easy, is it? Something just… Forces me to trudge forward. 


I’m trying to do a system overhaul. For the past nine months, it was my anger and sadness making me step forward. That brings us to this letter, and why I’m writing it. While I feel like I’ll never get a chance to have true closure or peace between you and I, or how this letter will likely never find its way to your possession, this has to do *something* for me. It represents what I wanted to say to you all this time without losing my cool and letting my anger or sadness take over my choice of words. I want closure. I want to be able to completely move on. I don’t want to lose it if I see you on the street. 

If this does anything, anything at all, I want it to be this: Please stop hurting yourself and others. The pain that you made us both suffer was enough. Be kind, and pleased don’t resent me because I was scared and thought I made the correct choice by leaving you. It wasn’t the right choice. I was aware of that the instant I made it. Have a good life, whether I’m part of it or not.

None seem to really work, and I care about him. When he starts throwing out his stuff, or starts to feed himself moldy leftovers, it hurts. 

This last time he was angered by something at work, then exploded when he ate a sandwich meant for me. My mom said ""Oh, that was for -myname-, oh well, you can eat it"" then he exploded. He keeps beating himself up over the sandwich, when we keep trying to tell him that it doesn't matter, and he can have it. ""That was the only thing I ate all day!"" says my dad, ""Then eat it!"" I respond. ""NO! I deserve this! LOOK AT THIS -pulls out moldy leftovers- I deserve to eat this!"" I proceed to try and force it away from him, successfully. ""You're going on the floor son."" He knocks me over, and we wrestle for a bit. I let him up, and he goes to the store after raging a bit, and buys me another sandwich.
When he comes back, he makes a big deal of it trying to make us feel guilty ""OH! I got you another sandwich! You happy now?!""

He constantly complains about how messy the house is, yet he gets angry when we do anything about it.
-""Don't you dare be doing laundry, because I don't deserve it! I deserve dirty socks, and nowhere to sleep.""

He's on a lot of meds, and he sees a therapist/psychiatrist regularly. I don't know how to help him, and it makes me want to give up. I haven't killed myself yet because I care about my dad more than myself, and if I went away, he would surely crack, and go himself.

I wanted to take the time to talk about my experiences and hopefully my words can help others. I believe depression is one of the worst things that can happen to the best people and no one deserves to be trapped this way.

The war began when I was 15. I don't remember the exact moment I internally discovered that I was depressed, I just remember every day was filled with anxiety and a struggle to do the simplest tasks. I saw a psychiatrist when I was 17. I was taken by the police to the children's psychiatric ward when a nurse at the hospital over heard a conversation my mom and I were having about me wanting to die. She had been admitted because her own depression made her drink herself to near death. While under a 72 hour psychiatric hold I was diagnosed with chronic depression, antisocial personality disorder and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. I wasn't prescribed anything because my dad was not willing to sign off on it. 

Fast-forwarding to my adulthood, my depression became barely manageable. My irritability, bad days, low energy and lack of emotional connection was getting worse. I began to hate everyone who was happy. I saw them as crazy and unrealistic because I was trying to accept my way of thinking as rational and perhaps the only rational way of thinking. My family and friends were not very supportive and kept telling me I was actively choosing to be negative and all I needed was to ""snap out of it"". Of course that didn't help. I spent a year thinking about suicide every day and attempted once by trying to overdose on over the counter sleeping aids. I put every justification that I could that I no longer needed to live and the attitude of those around me only verified for me that I was not wanted here. I was antagonized continually by co-workers about my attitude and so-called friends would make me feel worse by telling me ""my negativity was a black-hole"". I literally had no support and no health insurance to seek help and no will to carry on. Eventually, my depression became fits of rage. I would scream and cry, punch walls, cut myself, hit myself, break things... I wanted out. I was in a prison of my own body and every time I would hurt myself and be afraid of the pain it caused I would only become more enraged. I would scream at my fiancee's friends, threaten harm to them for back-talking or teasing me. 

At one point, I was emotionally dead. I had no care for anyone or anything and carried on every day like a zombie. I did the bare minimum and alienated everyone. I didn't have the courage to kill myself because I was afraid of the pain. I didn't want to screw it up and end up as an even greater burden on those around me. Nothing interested me, nothing even remotely gave me pleasure. I was gone.

My fiancee urged me to get help when I finally got the state provided medical insurance at no cost. Now I had no excuse. He came with me to the doctor's office when I went in for complaints of weight gain and hair loss. I was beginning to lose hair on my head and on my eyebrows and had been steadily gaining about 10 pounds a year. He told the doctor that I wasn't sleeping well. I snored really loud and at some points I'd hold my breath and jerk. This made me open up about the phantom, unexplained pain all over my body, the headaches, the fatigue. I wanted to think it was a thyroid condition, but my fiancee made me talk about my depression. She prescribed antidepressants to me and assured me this was a process. She told me this was not going to make me happy, happiness is a choice, this was only going to take the edge off and help me increase production of serotonin so that I could begin work on myself without the fog of the internal problems.

Now that I'm on my fourth day, I'm not really feeling anything different. I new it wasn't going to be a dramatic turn around, but I have noticed some things are different. For some reason the color green is exceptionally bright to me now. I don't fly off the handle as easily. I know this will take time and dedication, there is no easy fix for the years of damage done both physically and mentally. I guess the moral of my story is that at least attempting to get help, even if it's trial and error is better than doing nothing. Nothing does not help, in fact it makes the problem worse. I don't know if this medication will help, and if it will, I don't know for how long. I don't know if these years of depression have permanently damaged my brain or my body. I do know, however, that I don't want to go back. I want to live my life. I spent too long pretending that I was ok and that some day I'd get over these feelings, these lack of feelings, this suffering. I'm tired of watching everyone else around me have a good time and I'm sitting here thinking about death. I'm tired of my body breaking down this early because I have this mental block that keeps me from seeing what I'm not doing right. I'm on the Dean's List at my community college for the second semester in a row. I have a 4.0 GPA. I can fucking do this. I've got so much going for me that all those assholes who said I was worthless don't have and will never have. Now it's time to show them and show myself what's possible.

I don't understand how I can be so many different versions of myself in the pursuit. My mind won't let me be motivated. I started swimming about a month and a half ago, and ended up stopping about 2 and a half weeks ago. Why? I don't fucking know. I was actually enjoying swimming while I was doing it, even including the last session I did. Learning to be a great swimmer is essential to my dream, as are general fitness and learning not to be embarassed. The last two are very hard for me to motivate myself to do. But I was enjoying swimming, and my brain told me before every session that I shouldn't go; I'm wasting time; I'll hate it. I didn't while I was doing it nor after I finished. However, I finally gave into the thoughts. I stopped, and I can't seem to restart.

The thing is, I feel that this dream is the only thing I have to live for. I've thought about it. I *don't* want to die, but, as 2-year-oldish as it sounds, I know I will eventually resort to suicide if I can't achieve my dream, and I am, unfortunately, very impatient with myself.

This has been happening my whole life but finally I hit a brick wall and can't take it anymore and can't trust people.

I'm a teacher and wasn't able to get a teaching job so I had to deal with nannying jobs even though I didn't want to do that.

I'm unable to confide in any friends (I have about 2 and they're thousands of miles away) or family (because they blame me for my mental issues) and feel very lost.

I have good days and bad days. On the good days I think it's tough but I'll make it and be a great teacher. On the bad days I feel like I need to check myself into the mental hospital and/or move back near my family.

I've known since I was a child that I wanted to be a mom but I can't trust friends let alone SOs, I don't want to adopt since it's so expensive and I wonder if I'm mentally stable enough to even have kids.

I posted here awhile back about my depression and many of you said I should seek professional help, which I did. I went to the doctor to get a recommendation for a psychiatrist. He gave me two names and numbers, and also scheduled to have a blood test done on me to see if maybe my depression is thyroid-related or to some other hormone deficiency (as opposed to just being sad) and prescribed me with 10mg tablets of Citalopram, as a sort of holdover until I can get scheduled with a psychiatrist, since he said sometimes it can take a few months to be fit in.

Anyways, I have a question about the antidepressants. I know these things take a long long time to actually do their job, and the first few weeks can be kind of rough and be filled with anxiety and irritability, but I just want to know if what I'm feeling so far is normal. I took one pill at 7pm (it's 1am now). At around 9pm I didn't feel so good. My head felt heavy and I was kind of irritable and just wanted to hit something; it was fairly mild, not too serious, but the feeling was there. My heart also felt kind of funny. It's hard to describe, it was beating normally it just felt kind of weird. I heard Citalopram can intensify some heart conditions, and sometimes my heartbeat rhythm acts up (apparently it runs in the family) so maybe it's just that. Regardless, I sneezed and then my heart felt fine haha.

After that I was extremely tired and was hoping I could actually get a normal night's sleep tonight, but the feeling wore off after about half an hour and now I'm not tired anymore. But it seems that the effects of the medicine have completely gone now, is that normal? The only thing that feels different now is that I feel like my brain has sorta been dumbed-down. Kind of like when you're buzzed or drunk, it's harder for me to achieve higher levels of thought. It's very light but still noticeable. It may just be a coincidence though. I'm also noticing that I'm thinking happy thoughts now. Usually I have dark, depressing, or gruesome thoughts when I'm depressed, and now I'm just thinking about being happy and friendly and smiley to people, which is way off the norm. I was also having an argument with a friend earlier today, and later in the evening I was able to resolve things calmly without freaking out or exploding or having to sit in a dark corner and cry and think about what a terrible friend I am, so that's good too I guess.

So, I know it's way too early to tell, but is all of this normal for being on Citalopram? I'm mainly concerned about not feeling any effects from it any more and I'm curious as to whether or not the positive things I've been noticing are due to that or are just coincidence/placebo.

We did everything together- our favorite thing to do was to play army together. The streets were battlefields, bikes were tanks, guns we made out of wood. He taught me how to skateboard and I shoot a slingshot. I got my first slingshot that summer, my first ""weapon"".
We chases down ice cream trucks, played video games only when we weren't able to run around outside like little maniacs. Played with toy army men when it was raining; making battle scenes out of the grass and dirt. Drew buildings in te streets with chalk and road out bikes in the made up roads creating ""Chalk Town"".
When school started, we'd play at recess whenever we could. We were almost in the spelling bee together until I got sick. I introduced him to my friends in school, but we both knew they would never understand how grey our friendship was. People thought it was strange, I'm a girl, he's a boy- best friends???!! Yes. We were. Our parents joked that someday we'd get married. We would just look at each other and giggle. We were only 10, who thinks about that stuff anyways?
He invited me to his birthday party, just me and another friend of his. We had a blast. We went ice skating and watched him open his presents. That's the day his mom snapped the picture of us. Back then, I thought pictures were stupid, but I look back at it now and think ""man, I wish I would have let my dad take more pictures."" I'd do anything for another picture.
One day in the winter, we went sledding. Just the two of us. We built a snowman and a ramp and had the greatest time. We must have been out in the cold for nearly 7 hours. When we were done, we went to y house and had hot chocolate.
We played army in the snow too of course. That was our favorite thing to do. He's the reason I had such an interest in the military now. I collect ww2 stuff now and every now and then think about joining in a few yearS.
Now, here I am in my room. Looking at a picture and wishing I was 10 again. He moved to Texas when I started 6th grade. Were friends in Facebook, but he's never really on. I have his phone number, but I haven't texted him in years. I miss him. I miss that summer. I miss being a kid. I want I go back and relive that summer.

I've barely posted on the site and I occasionally lurk and read, but I don't participate much.  This is a common trend for me - In every community I kinda just keep to the sidelines and watch.  I don't necessarily want to be outside looking in - it's what I always just end up doing.  Failure hurts less when no one sees you do it.

 

I feel lost.  I genuinely feel like I'm in Groundhog Day.  Every day feels the same.  The only real marking of time passing is my various characters in the various MMOs I still dabble in occasionally still level up or find a new piece of gear.  I occasionally try to go out of my way to do something to break the monotony but it usually leaves me feeling worse off.

 

I think I'm rambling, let me start from the top.

 

My name is Icarus, I'm 26 years old, currently work at a video game retail store.  Right now I live with my mom, dad, grandma, and three of my four siblings.  I'm the oldest.  I have an absolutely wonderful girlfriend with a catch - she's currently in Canada and I'm still stateside.  Southern stateside.  Georgia.  Georgia is a hell of a long way from Ontario.  The distance is hard.

 

I grew up bullied pretty heavily.  A part of it was because I was homeschooled up until High School.  And then I was dropped into a small, private Christian school with very pre-established cliques.  High school was hell for me and it still weighs heavily on me.  I try to let it go but I didn't really make any friends.  I graduated more to spite my classmates than for myself.  The depression took hold about a year later when I learned that a lot of what I learned in that little private school was simply false - I was in no way, shape, or form prepared for college.

 

I've failed out of three different colleges now.  It's not because I don't understand what's being taught - the depression takes over and I give up.  I let assignments go by.  I panic on tests.  I convince myself I'm no good and never will be.  My parents are extremely disappointed but fake smiles for me.  I see right through the smiles and it hurts more than anything.

 

I like my job but the hours and pay are terrible.  I'm barely scraping by and that's even with my parents helping me out.  I've tried to land a second job but it feels like no one around here is really hiring.  Or the places that are want people with ridiculous qualifications.

 

I don't know what to do.  More than anything I want to move up to Canada.  Not just for my girlfriend but because I want a fresh start.  I want to go somewhere new, meet new people, shake it up.  I'm stagnant here and it's killing me.  But I can't even begin to afford that move plus I have no idea how to even get the process started to get up there.  It's all so confusing and overwhelming to me and I panic.

 

My debts never seem to get any smaller.  I feel like I'll die here.  I feel like this is all my life has left to offer and it makes me scared.  I don't know what to do.  I don't have any real friends.  I don't have money to really go out and try to make any.  The things I enjoyed doing I can't even do anymore.  I just feel so beaten down.

 

I hate being lonely.  I hate being poor.  I hate feeling trapped.  I don't want to die or hurt myself but I am genuinely starting to wish I didn't exist.  It hurts.  I want to cry but crying only gets uncomfortable conversations with the family.

 

I need help, but I don't know how to get it or who to even ask for it.

 

I just want to smile and not feel like I had to force it.  I want to feel like I have friends and belong to a community.  I want to feel like I matter, even on a small scale.  I want my mind to stop being so loud so I can focus and think.

I'm not sure anyone will even read this or care.  :/  People I know IRL didn't seem to.  But I just needed to vent this out somewhere...

I have been through some physical and emotional abuse as a child. My father was abusive, and my mother failed to protect us.

At the time, I was in touch with a girl from my past who lives thousands of miles away (across the ocean actually.) We were best friends for several months and we had a ton of fun together. We are both gamers so we played with and against each other in some games, spent a lot of time on Skype together, etc. In May of last year she talked me into seeing the doctor and that is when I was diagnosed with depression.

Anyway, we got closer and closer to each other, and eventually things went beyond friendship. Then, one day out of the blue, she had moved on and didn't want to speak to me or hear from me anymore. Literally, overnight it ended.

To go into my history a little bit, I have never been in any kind of relationship with anyone, ever. I'm 25 and do and always have hated the way I look.

RayAP19,,,1402668177,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/281vds/they_call_them_excuses_we_call_them_fears_why/,281vds,True,2,False,1441313526,9,"Here's an interesting analogy I thought of while making this thread. Batman fans will get it immediately, and even if you're not a fan of the Caped Crusader, it's very simple:

Bane. The mask that he wears essentially keeps him alive, although that's slight hyperbole. If he takes it off, he won't die-- he'll just be in incredible, excruciating pain until he puts it back on.

""Tough love""-ers will accuse those who suffer from crippling depression of being weak, good-for-nothing losers who sit around being unproductive everyday-- playing video games, watching TV, surfing the web, eating unhealthy foods, and neglecting their own hygiene and responsibilities.

They do this because they might understand the concept of a ""comfort zone,"" but they don't understand the extent to which a comfort zone is important to someone who's being psychologically mauled by depression for every second of his/her life.

That's where the analogy becomes relevant. Many people with severe anxiety/depression can tell you that their comfort zone is like Bane's mask-- technically, we don't need it to live, but being without it causes us unimaginable pain, and when we ask for help to get through the pain when we don't have the mask to put on, all some of us get in return is ""Do it yourself. You're an adult."" (I'm 25)

For example, my ""mask"" is basically my room, which I assume is somewhat normal for a person who's depressed. If it wasn't for video games, television, and the internet to distract me from the fact that I want to break down into tears for no reason during every single waking moment of my life, I'd probably go insane.

Certain people in my life expect me to take the mask off, leave my comfort zone, and do things like look for work or apply for school (my grades sucked in high school, and I had to withdraw from junior college because the work plus my depression simply overwhelmed me).

I try to tell them it's not that easy, and that while it's technically possible and I won't die if I take three hours out of my day to go out and look for jobs, I'd be so miserable the entire time that I'll have to spend the rest of the day recovering from the pain once I put the mask back on.

Now, if Bane had someone to help him endure the pain by being there with him, encouraging him, etc., as he fought through it, I bet it'd be a lot easier. When I ask for help, though, I get the same thing-- ""You're an adult.""

Sure, I'm an adult. But I consider myself, and many other people I see in many places, to be psychologically crippled by depression.

Imagine that someone you care about, adult or not, has two broken legs and can't walk. Suddenly, they fall out of their wheelchair and ask you to help them up. Would you tell them to stop bitching and get back up themselves (which they technically could do-- it'd just be very difficult), or would you offer a hand?

Yeah, I'm done venting. I just wish I had someone in my life who could be my emotional crutch (which, for some reason, I think has a negative connotation-- someone who's impaired needs a crutch. It makes sense to me).

I've been depressed for at least 15 years and I've never had one. Why am I a bad person for being afraid of things that are scary (essentially, life outside of my comfort zone)? Don't I deserve someone (in a personal, not professional, capacity-- a friend, family member, etc., as opposed to a psychologist) to help me get over my fears and overcome my depression?

**NOTE:** I used the term ""we"" many times throughout this post-- if I'm the exception rather than the rule, and I'm really just horrendously lazy and basically a waste of life because that's who I am and not because of psychological issues, I apologize for grouping myself with others who suffer from depression.",depression,t5_2qqqf,"They call them ""excuses.""

So I guess I'm just venting/looking for some advice/support/idk anymore through the internet since it's 3:30 am and I don't know who to talk to.

Anyone else just kinda feel like ""man, if I went to sleep and didn't wake up it'd be AWESOME."" I'd never kill myself (honestly), but that's all I can think most nights... like, finally I don't have to do IT (life? people? work? school? etc.) anymore.

I'm in a weird place with my feelings right now, because due to various life circumstances (to be revealed shortly), I feel terrible (see above). But I'm a really no-nonsense kind of person when it comes to emotions, if I'm honest. I know that side-bar says ""no tough love"" but I genuinely have a hard time feeling sorry for myself being sad (my logic is flawless!). But it creates a weird struggle when I'd rather not wake up in the morning but simultaneously want to tell myself to get the fuck out of bed and go be a happy and productive member of society.

My life: VERY, VERY indebted graduate student from a lower middle class family in one of those ""useless"" degrees that commentors on news websites say ""deserve what they got"" (but I'll be honest, I'm hella good at what I do, and I stand a chance in the market, so fuck those guys), closeted gay and overweight (a very unfortunate combination), incredibly homophobic parents, etc. etc. woe is me

I guess the meat of this is just gonna be that... I feel terrible. Most days. And mostly lonely. Incredibly lonely. But lonely with a lot of good friends, ya know? I spent a long time crafting an image of a person who people would want to be around to get those friends and they are legitimately good people, I'm not trying to say ""oh they're so shallow because they won't accept ME boohoo.""

When I was 15 & 17 my school / college was providing support for my self harm, depression, and anxiety issues through counseling with a school counselor and making schedules for me with other organisations free for me to attend to. 

 
They've helped me so much to manage myself but after being out of the routine of being checked up on I've found myself dipping and unable to get on without other people's help. It was always a major concern for myself that as I got older and had more responsibility for myself the greater risk I put myself in. Last week I decided to get some exercise instead of being inside all day and decided to go swimming. Whilst I was swimming I had the worst panic attack I've ever had in my life. I went straight to the changing room and called 3 different people to keep me talking as I felt like I was going to pass out. It was embarrassing as the staff had to get involved aswell as my mum fetching me, they were considering calling an ambulance but I asked them not to. 

Since then I've felt like I haven't had much control over myself because its the first incident to happen in a long time and had nobody to talk to this about. It's made me feel like all of the counseling was for nothing and this is the beginning of me slowing getting back to a deep depression and eventually again into self harm. 

I was considering getting an appointment with my GP soon to speak about what support I have available but I don't really think having the regular counseling sessions and behavioral therapy I had will help so much in the longterm. (they were mostly for anxiety anyway) 

Is it common for people similar to me to return to how they had been in the past? I just feel like its something so integral to me now I dont think I could ever change.

I've been hospitalized a lot and then I take my meds and get off of them because of the serious side effects. I start smoking very potent marijuana and the cycle just seems to repeat itself. I dont want to take seroquel because like all drugs the side effects  are awful! 

Should I admit my guilt!? I've done a lot of crimes throughout my life.  I was so afraid of the prospect of going back into inpatient that I took the pill my relative had to get for me for my psychotic symptoms. I don't even know if I'm even capable of standing before a trial.

I've been in so much pain my head hurts and I kept trying to tell the voices in my head to stfu and I know everything I was doing was wrong because I didn't seek out intensive out patient treatment. I just hated being on meds because of the potential long term damage. Restarting seroquel has definitely effed me up today and I am so confused on what I should honestly do to get off and recover to lead a semi functional life. I've been on Lamictal for a while and have been med compliant with that drug because it doesn't make me become obese. I don't want to start antidepressants or any other narcotic drug. 

tl;dr
Is there some kind of website from the government that can help me figure out all these mental health issues with medications and laws!? ",BipolarReddit,t5_2qzru,Triggering I had to go to the ER for a prescription.

My favorite summer was in 2008 because that's when all my neighborhood friends still lived here. I did so much that summer. Made a new best friend- Dylan. Dylan taught me how to skateboard, shoot a slingshot, to jump on a scooter. We played army together all the time and I loved it so much. That summer my sister and I rode bikes around town, something we've never done before. It was like an adventure each time. She didn't have her license yet so we rode bikes. We went to the pool together and sometimes my friends were there too. My favorite time of year was July 4. The parents would set off (legal) fireworks in the street. Us kids would sit on te curb and watch. We'd pretend those pop its were grenades, sparklers were wands, fireworks were artillery. Back then I loved everything- I loved summer the most, my friends, my family, school, everything. Well, two years later Dylan moved. I never got to say goodbye because I thought he was coming back. Then the others moved. Everyone moved. I stayed. No goodbyes, no hugs, nothing. Then later that year my school friends bullied me. They bullied me about every single flaw I had- the freckles on my face, te slight acne I was getting. My teacher actually asked me during a parent teacher conference if I was ok. She asked that because she saw my grades were slipping, I sat alone at luck ad recess, I did projects by myself, I never talked to anyone, I never laughed. She asked if I had any friends in that class and I lied. I said I did. Now I think that if I told the truth would things be different now? When I started middle school I sat alone the first two months. I didn't have that teacher who asked if I was okay anymore. I was alone. My grades slipped and I didn't care. I stayed in my room all the time and my parents never cared. My sister moved out because she graduated. I was alone.

It's 2014, I'm a 16 year old girl and, man, I just want to say- FUCK DEPRESSION. FUCK IT FOR MAKING ME HATE THE THINGS I USED TO LOVE. There's not one single day I can go without depression sneaking up on me. I'm not sad, I'm not mad, I'm not happy- I'm numb. Depression is a black hole that just took everything. I'm nothing anymore- I'm just some living, breathing being on earth. 

I have one person that I care about. My teacher/friend/sister. Mrs W. She was my Spanish teacher my freshman and sophomore year. I'm very close to her. I thought for a moment ""I have a reason to live because if I died, I wouldn't be able to see Mrs W."" But it's summer now. I won't be in high school in two years. Depression has ruined other friendships before. I make friends and then lose them because they either bully me or we just lose contact. It's a repeating pattern that is like a 100% guarantee. Well,
Mrs W is my friend. I don't want that to happen. It's already a bad summer because I don't get to see my favorite teacher everyday like I used to. What about after high school? It's going to happen, I know it. No matter how close I am to someone, no matter how much they mean to me IT ALWAYS HAPPENS.

Bad things always happen during the summer. So, thanks depression for making something I used to love to something I hate more than anything. I want to always be friends with Mrs W, but you're not going to let that happen. I want to be me again. I hope every single day that I might get hit by a car or shot in the head so I don't have to do it myself. My old self NEVER would have thought if that. But you like to ruin people. You like to tear is apart. Fuck everything ",depression,t5_2qqqf,Can I take a minute to rant about how much I hate summer?

Before today, we had been seeing eachother almost everyday and he did not like the fact. He desired more space than that and I found myself unable to officially provide him with space.

But I reasoned with him and proposed a break rather than a break up. He didn't 100% want to go so he agreed with the idea of a break. We made the rules that I am not to initiate conversation with him whatsoever in the next couple of weeks. Any conversation between him and I will be initiated by him exclusively. This is going to be very hard for me as I am used to constantly keeping in contact and talking to him at all hours of the day, and getting upset if he was away for say, half an hour to an hour. I'm not sure how to handle this, but I know it has to be done. I need to stop obsessing over him and have some amount of detachment to him if I want to have a healthy relationship with him at all. I'm just wondering if I can do it. I'm wondering if he will decide to stay with me with all this space we'll be having. I wonder if I can continue not to talk to him for all this time, and wait for him to talk to me. I wonder if I can let go. I hope I can.

My whole life I have preferred to be alone, or with 1-2 other people.
Presentations were always hell for me.. and the only reason going to the store was fine was becuase the focus was on who I was with(parents/older sibling) and not me.
I've seen some people say that it's all in my head and I should just be myself. The problem is it's not just all in my head, not completely. I am somewhat ""dumb"", I have trouble finding words to express myself, I have no oppinion on things like society or politics or anything. I barely know what ring-winged or left-winged entails etc

I went to college and dropped out, partly due to my social anxiety(although it wasn't the biggest reason), and now it's time to get a job.
Since I've been unemployed for so long I have to go to some sort of ""class"" every day for 6 weeks that are supposed to help you get a job(but it's seriously just adult daycare). Each Wednesday we have off to do homework we get on Tuesday. There's a lot of questions and group exercises and just thinking about them makes me anxious and I just want to sit in a corner and die.

On to a question, I suppose...
* What kind of jobs do you guys have and what kind of jobs would be doable for someone with SA?

Also, how do you live with it? I can see no future where a simple task such as bowling doesn't make me anxious and feel sick. It just feels like everyone is watching me, judging me. One time the guy behind the desk seemed to be looking over in my direction.. judging how badly I was doing? I just felt bad the whole time.

It's friday night and I'm already nervous about the ""class"" starting again on Monday. What job could I possibly get? Social interaction makes me anxious and I'm terrified of making mistakes. I want a job where you literally sit somewhere, alone, and press a button every 5 minutes. That's like the only job I could see myself doing. It might be a bit boring but at least I won't want to kill myself.
Every employer wants you to be extroverted, not having SA etc.. Someone ""normal"". I would never kill myself(hurt those left behind / some tiny hope of life somehow getting better) but I just do not see a future that isn't just 100% agony..",socialanxiety,t5_2r22n,Getting a job / living with SA

When I'm alone I get tempted to try to kill myself. I own a few knives, some my day gave me and others I bought myself, and think about putting the knife through me. I know where the guns in my house are at, I know how to use them. I take Prozac and have two full bottles of them because I haven't taken my pills for the last month. I also take Xanax once in a while to calm down. I don't want to live off pills anymore, I haven't used them since my grandma died last month. I just don't wanna use pills anymore. 
I ride my bike and sometimes think about twitching the handlebars into the direction of traffic. I don't wear a helmet, despite my teacher persuading me to. I hope and pray every single day that I will be wandering somewhere and someone decides to put a bullet through my head. The summer is the worst because I'm always alone. I'm not close with my parents. I'm only close with my favorite teacher but I won't have her next year. 

I keep a box under my bed. The box has all my pills and knives and my suicide note. I call it my emergency box in case I want to do it. I also keep a picture of me as my teacher in there and letters she gave to me like on my birthday and Christmas. I keep another picture of me and my best friend from when we were younger in there. I keep those things under there in hopes that if things do get really tough, I realize that my teacher is there for me. I keep it there to remember what she told me one day; that if any one if her students committed suicide that she wouldn't be the same. She told me she would be heartbroken because all her students mean a lot to her. She never said what my other teachers and friends said that ""people that are suicidal are selfish."" She said instead that she thinks that suicidal people think that no one cares about them. Sometimes I do think that. She made me promise her that if I ever thought of suicide and felt that nobody cared about me, to tell her and she would prove my thinking of no one caring wrong. That was the only time she talked about suicide to me. 
That made me think: I don't wanna be the reason she hates teaching in the future if one of her students committed suicide. I don't want her to change because she honestly can make anyone smile. Other people need someone like her, I don't want that to change.
So that's why I do that. But some days I get scared that I'll actually go through wih it. I don't want to die, but I don't wan to live. Does that even make sense? I don't want to live *this* kind of life where I feel like the inside of me is just a black hole. There have been days I've come really close. Just yesterday I almost drowned myself in the pool on purpose. The only thing that stopped me is realizing there were kids in that pool and I didn't want to scar them.
I realize now I can't do this alone. These thoughts won't go away by magic or some miracle, but I don't know how to deal with it. Can one of you guys help me? I know I post here a lot, but you all provide such a sense of comfort and I love you all for that.",depression,t5_2qqqf,Can someone give me some advice?

Four or five years ago, he was a kid who was doing well in school, had friends and was starting to pick subjects and narrow down his choices. Eventually, he'd go to university, graduate with a good degree from somewhere with a good reputation and get a decent job. He'd probably get a family and a home. He wasn't actually special, but he wasn't a waste. He had a good future, set up by good teachers and parents. Probably not going to be a millionaire or a celebrity. He wasn't going to discover a cure for cancer, but he wasn't going to be homeless, unwashed or perpetually unemployed. 

That guy is gone, and I'm the only one who really knows it. I'm at university based on achievements from a few years ago. Good achievements, but I don't feel like they were won by me. They were won by some other guy who died and was quietly replaced by a wreck who has crisps crumbs from six months ago still on the carpet and is wearing a t-shirt that hasn't been washed since easter. No-one told his teachers or professors, and his parents didn't notice. At least, not that much. They know he's got a few anxiety issues, but they have no idea. Everyone thinks I'm the clever, happy kid from when I was 15, but I barely even know him. I know about him, his school reports and his hobbies. I don't feel like him though. I don't remember what he knew. I don't know how he felt about the world, or what he thought about anything. I don't even really remember what it is I've lost, but I'm pretty sure it was good. 

I'm not that guy any more, but people keep treating me like I am. I hate that. I don't deserve my parents paying money for accommodation and food so I can go to university I'm about to drop out of because I can't even force myself to check my email and see about module registration or my results. I don't deserve the place at the uni anyway. It was earned by someone who wasn't me and should have gone to someone else who isn't me.

I need my family to stop caring. Stop making me feel guilty for money and attention I don't deserve. I've taken so much from so many people and just thrown it right back in their face. The wasted time and money and hopes from my family. The effort of my teachers. Every time anyone has tried to talk to me for the past year and I've just ignored them or been awkward and closed. I feel so bad. People try so hard. I'm told on reddit and stuff that I have to help me. That it's up to the individual to help themselves. That's fucking bullshit. No it's not. Almost everyone we encounter in some way exists to serve us in that situation. Whether it's literally, because they're working in retail or schools, or it's just because they're trying to make friends and be nice. I'm just not worth it. 

Maybe if I was actually on my own I'd do something. I'd stop just spending money on food because I can afford to buy a nice sandwich or a mcdonalds rather than a load of bread and a pack of ham. I might actually do some work, pass my exams and get a degree. And if I don't, oh well. It's not like anything's been lost. I'm not so special I can't be replaced.

At this point the festival was basically over, all I could do was go pack up my stuff and go home.

There was still a light, though. I was invited to a friends cabin that evening when I got home, and most of my closest friends would be there. And I went. And then I came back home, because there I was overwhelmed by a horrible feeling of being an outsider. Of not belonging there, to be with my oldest friends. They all recounted some funny things that had happened when they were together the last time, but in absolutely none of these storied did I have a part in.

Around middle school, I became seriously obsessed with this one girl. Like, I would write poems about her during class, give her chocolates every Valentine's Day, and just sort of hover around her constantly. This obsession grew for about four years, and then one day I decided to face my Juliet and profess my undying love for her. 

Given the fact that we were way too young to be thinking about things like that, she backed off hard. I completely understood that I came on as creepy, but the sorrow just knocked me out with a Sad-Falcon-Punch. For a month I just felt no reason to live, as my sole purpose in life had just abandoned me. 

Fast-forward to high school and beyond, and I haven't felt the slightest attraction to any of the girls. I've actually been approached by a girl or two, giving me their numbers. Haven't called a single time. It's like my ability to love was numbed down. Couple that with my temperament issues, and I just don't feel right anymore. I don't even hold feelings for the girl; she moved shortly after middle school. So uh, what's wrong with me?

Art like this is one reason that I feel like dying would be a shitty thing to do, on principle. And I don't want pain and suffering to be the last thing I do, not to mention the trouble caused to others!

I've always considered myself respectful of others. I don't complain.

I know what's going on here.

It's that I don't think I can stop it. There is no delusional sense of empowerment here, no /r/fatpeoplestories analogue. I'm a fuckup. I'm done. I was not made to live, I'm an evolutionary dead end. I do a lot of things WELL, but most of the time I don't feel any sense of reward for doing them, it's all naive hope that ""I can beat this, this are going to be better."" and every hope ends up crashing into reality.

I never considered using my depression to get me out of anything. Hell, I managed to graduate this past May after 5 years. Never once did I take a semester off for medical leave, even though I should have at times.

At one point I worked 2 part-time jobs and was doing school. Without a car, so I had to walk to and from campus sometimes, which was a 30 minute walk.

All that is not relevant really, just me trying to stroke my own ego.

But then there are things...

Like my sleep schedule is very much not normal. My internal clock is basically switched, and I sleep all day and get up in the late afternoon/evening. It really bothers me, and I've tried caffeine and even trying to stay up all day so I can sleep around 2-3 a.m. But somehow my body gets stuck and come the time, my body still stays up.  

My roommate/friend who I see an older brother, was trying to tell me ways to possibly get my sleep schedule  so that I can get up in the morning. I told him I tried these things, but my body just doesn't seem to work. Then he used the ""e"" word. Excuse. I tried to bite my tongue, but when he kept bringing up my sleep and how I sleep all day, I lashed out how I do try but it just doesn't seem to work. He apologized  afterwards, saying he didn't mean excuse in the sense of trying to get out of something. He just didn't want to see me self-defeated.

Last Monday night, I was across the country visiting my long distance boyfriend. I ended up having an emotional breakdown, which involved me crying/dry heaving for 30 minutes and talking about all the things in my life I was scared about or wished were different. He held me and listened, but from his lips also came out the ""e"" word. This came to me as a surprise and I cried even harder having heard it before.
I also figured since he had his own personal problems with mental illness in the past, he would understand me better. But even he couldn't. He said he had learned to move on from it all. I guess in that moment I truly felt alone. 

Now I'm having a discussion with another reddit user who once again used the ""e"" word, in a thread where I simply asked to make some friends. They're going on about how I need to not focus on the negatives and get not wait for life to get better but go out and do something about it.

My depression really, really, makes me feel distanced from people. It's like, everyone is looking down on me with a judging eye and chanting ""Excuse"".

It hurts. I want to yell. I want to scream. How dare you all tell me I'm making excuses. No one would bat an eye if it were a physical illness. But because it's mental, it becomes an excuse. My emotional pain becomes an ""excuse"". My body not cooperating with me is an ""excuse"". It makes me want to be a hermit and say fuck everyone.
As much as I try and explain, they won't get it. They won't understand the pain I feel. How I do try and fight.

It could have been worse. I could have raged with fuck yous and anger and terrible terrible shit. I could have broken property or threw away truly meaningful gifts. But I didn't. After thinking on things for a few hours and getting more and more into the straight psychotic frame of mind I decided to drive over to his house and leave his birthday present on his porch and leave and then explain later when I could that I just wanted him to have it because I wasn't sure if I would be around in a few days. 


On the way over I started thinking that he might stil be up, instead of sleeping off the killer headache he said he had. Or even worse, I started thinkin he was cheating on me. I've been feeling those bad thoughts all week. I told myself I would be calm when I got there and would just knock on the door if his lights were on. I kept repeating to myself for the 15 minute drive that I was going to handle this calmly. 


I got there, saw his light was on and was overcome. I knew I had done wrong right then and there, even though I was trying to not do things I would regret. I chucked the present at bis door and left. He tried calling me several times and texting me too. He took this as a fuck you we are done. I wanted me exit to be silent and disappear.

When I suddenly change behaviour because I’m a very impulsive person, I think that they will abandon me… so I abandon them before they do (yes, I have no friend…)

Suicidal Behaviour :  Every night I think about suicide. Want to kill myself so I can end the pain. Seriously though, I’m a fat guy with a lazy left eye (had surgery, did absolutely FA), with a really shitty personality. Who would want to be friend or even live with a guy like me ? I’m clearly doomed to be alone for the rest of my life, and I don’t want that, so might as well kill myself instead of being worthless.

Impulsive Behaviour : Heh. It’s ridicoulous. Even for the smallest of things. Going back to the glass of water, I’d punch a wall if it ever happens again. I hate myself for it to the point where I feel worthless. It’s like life is saying to me : Hey mate, you can’t even take a glass of water properly… see how worthless you are lol ?

Bad Thoughts : When something bad happens, let it be something really insignificant, like dying in a video game, all sorts of bad thoughts come into my mind. It could be mental bullying from something that I don’t have any control over, suicidal behaviour, giving up everything because I feel useless and worthless, all that kind of stuff.

Loneliness : The number of friend I had in my life… could be counted on one hand. So yeah, I was really lonely for the most part of my life… and it slowly got to me. I’ve started talking to myself at 10ish years old. And by talking to myself, I mean, legitimate conversation. I talk to myself by calling myself you. I tell myself jokes alone in my room, and I laugh at them like I’ve never heard it before. I see something new on the internet, and I go : Wow dude, you know that blablabla ? And I answer myself. You get the point.

So yeah basically, all of this gets me depressed every night because I have no control over anything. I’ve recently bonded back with a childhood friend, she’s really nice ! She wanted to hang out with me and her boyfriend, and I said YES ! But then something bad happened, something really insignificant, and I gave up on her. Long story short, I can’t have relationships anymore because I’m paranoiac, depressive, impulsive and I can’t stand talking to people anymore. I’ve grown up talking to myself… and I’ve never had any problem with myself. But with people… That’s all I’ve had, problems.

And I don’t want to go see a doctor… It won’t change anything. I want to change, but at the same time I don’t want to. Like I said, I can’t stand people anymore. And all my problems come when I interact with people.

But holy shit do I want some friends. I want to have fun with other people… I want to play games with other people. I want to become a better person… with a better personality. But laziness and all the above are preventing me from that.",depression,t5_2qqqf,I don't know what to do (19yo male)

She texted me today asking if I'd like to help her. I replied back saying I'd love to. I haven't seen her since the last day of school. I miss her a lot and being able to see her would be awesome.
I've had a lot of friends in the past, a lot of teachers too. I always hoped that I'd always be friends with those friends or always stay in contact with those teachers. I realized that every friend I made, the friendship never lasted long. Those teachers, they never replied to my emails when they said they would. In my freshman year of high school, I wanted to die. I was sick and tired of depression and losing friends I thought meant the world to me. My teacher, the one I consider a sister, saved my life. She's the first friend I ever think of as a teacher. The first teacher who always replies back. The teacher who is always there for me, and I hope I can do the same. I'll be a junior this upcoming year. I had her as my teacher in my sophomore year too (she's a Spanish teacher so she teaches multiple levels of Spanish.)
I have other friends and I had other teachers too of course. But knowing for sure I'll always have a friend- it's nice. I don't know if I'll always be friends with my other friends, but my teacher- I know well always be friends. That's the first time I've ever said that.
I won't see her until Saturday, but hopefully I can thank her in some way just how much she means to me and how much she's helped me. I don't think I could ever thank her enough. ",depression,t5_2qqqf,Saturday is going to be a good day

I told myself that I wasn't going to give up but I think I finally will. I'm literally turning into a zombie. I don't care about anything. I've lost interest in the things that used to interest me. I cannot see who I am or was anymore. I do not know what the truth is.

I've fucked up my future. I do want to die but not in suffering so I at least wanted to get a college degree and maybe go medical school. Not that much. I withdrew from my university after two years of hardship during attending only to find out that it won't get better. I'm not good enough to transfer anywhere else or have a chance for that. I've tried to look for help and guidance but it virtually doesn't exist. I will have to go back. The only chance I have at surviving is getting a degree so I really want one. I feel like school has always been a huge contributor to my depression but something that kept me busy or at least my mind from thinking when I wasn't because I was tired and unable to. I hate thinking and that's all I've done while being home. 

I've been suffering from depression for a while and it creeped up hard during my first year of college. With my major, it's been a clear pattern of failing a math/science class and repeating it. I know that I'm capable of doing way better than I have done but I don't know if this is true and that I probably really do suck. My results have made me feel horrible. I halfway cared and did the minimum when I wanted to care more and do more but just couldn't because it was somehow impossible for me. I know the positive effects of working with a study group and having others who give a crap about you in general but, I've always been unlucky; or UNDESERVING of someone's attention and desire to be in a study group with me or like anything. I'm not magnetic or interesting. I feel like I'm not normal or even human. There are a lot of idiots out there but I seem to kind of like people. 

Now with all this wasted time I am behind and back at home for summer for the first time in two years since I have left.
I couldn't afford to give up then but now, I'm just as useless and displaced as when they cut me from the Varsity soccer team junior year of high school. I never had much of life or lived much and I definitely don't have one at home. I don't know how to live as a regular person anymore and functioning is beginning to be a problem. I hate home and a lot of NorCal. I have no friends and I get anxiety about being around people now. I barely care and don't want to do anything, even if it's remotely enjoyable.

I'm fat and out of shape. As it turns out, my brain/smarts can't save me either so I am absolutely damned as a female. The truth is that I don't like being myself and I never wished that I was myself. I wish that I could erase myself or just cease to exist and have the world go on. I don't see myself in the future or having one. I can't.
I have tried taking steps to make things better for my life but they have all blown up in my face or I became bored for whatever reason. I've been trying to support myself and be there for myself because I am all that I have in this but I just can't anymore. I can't tell my mom or talk to anyone about this because apparently to them, depression is for psychos and doesn't truly exist. It has a bad stigma which sucks. It's like a 'western'/American concept to them. I am trapped.

There was also a poster my friend brought and showed to me. When she left the poster (of a woman's face) on the sofa and she left the room. When I looked at the woman's face, before she was smiling a nice smile but then it turned into a grimace that I could feel was completely evil with all of my being. I was so curious that I wanted to stare at her longer but the more I looked the more I felt like shitting my pants because it was so scary.

Before mental hospital I was in a state of ""I want to die, I am worthless, no one loves me and I am not worth the time it will take to become better"". 
I had an unstable relationship to my father. I don't know why I hated him all the years, he did not do anything wrong. He never hit me, he did not abuse me, nothing in this direction. He always was supportive and protecting. 
6 years ago was the last time I hugged him or even said that I love him, even when I always scream at him. Yesterday I talked to my therapist and told her that I actually love him. He is kind, has a sense of humour and gives me so much freedom ( we are a Muslim family and we are rather liberal). So she asked me, if I can try to be kind to him. I did. And everything went better than I expected! He cried in my arms and was happy that I told him, how much I actually love him.

The relationship to my best friend also became better. I managed to understand her more than before (she also has Depression and BPD with an Eating-Disorder). I can cope with texts like "" I want to be alone for a while, just don't text me, I need space."" 

It is a lot better to just understand your environment and the circumstances other individuals live in. I observe myself, my actions and words to improve in behaviour and thinking. I still have negative thoughts, but which person does not have those? 

A tip for all of us: Remind yourself what your strenghts are. Because we are worthy! We should not forget that we are human beings, who feel intensive about everything that happens. But that does not mean, we are not strong! 

I know that there will be low points as in the last months, but now I can handle the situation, because of the new knowledge. 

I hope I could bolster you up that BPD and depression can be handled, we only have to be open to ourselves and let others talk to us, without getting angry at a word or sentence. It was a hard way. I have been suffering from Depression and BPD for 4 years now and was twice in a mental hospital. I started treatment 1 year ago and I kept trying, even in the darkest moments.

Thank you for reading. I wish you all the best!",BPD,t5_2qqdp,I am getting better!

Over the past month I've been spiralling worse than ever and its getting to the point where im going to lose my boyfriend over it, I dont blame him because of how it makes me act, we've never had problems in the past unless it was a bad day for my depression. I really dont want to lose him of course, we see each other 3-4 times a month and he makes me truely happy and content with who I am, he makes me feel beautiful and important, whenever we're together irl everything seems so surreal and perfect - no arguments, I dont get down or even a little sad and its the most amazing feeling in the world to be with him, he just has that thing, it feels like theres a fire in my tummy every time I look at him one second and next second its butterflies and ""damn how the hell did I get this lucky"" no matter what we do I feel this way, if we're cuddling, playing video games, watching a movie/tv or going for a walk. I truly believe he is the one for me, hes the whole package, handsome, funny, smart, caring... just everything... I ***do*** still feel this way about him even when hes not here, its just having him here or me being there just affirms it 100times over, one little kiss means more to me that 1000 long distance ""I love you""s, I get that same love struck feeling just thinking about kissing/cuddling him, hes my happy place, when I'm with him everything is just.... Right. Even though we're young I've never felt anything close to how I feel about him and I cant help falling deeper in love every time I look at him or hear his voice... Sorry to ""gush"" but it feels important that you guys understand how I feel about him 

We had a serious talk last night and it ended with us almost breaking up and thats all it took, it opened my eyes, now I know I really need to take action and get help for the sake of our relationship, I spoke it over with our mutual best friend (he introduced us) and he was shocked to find out we were having troubles as he also believes us to be an absolute perfect match (as do all our friends)

I got less than two hours sleep last night and even then I kept waking up.. itd switch between waking in a hot sweat, overheating and with sick in my throat feeling absolutely sick to my stomache with worry that I'm going to lose my boyfriend, and then the next time I woke up I was in floods of tears of happiness because I thought I could feel his arms around me, I feel so confused and tired but I want this to be fixed.... Hopefully by the end of the day I'll have an appointment at the doctors and will have convinced my boyfriend we arent better off away from each other, I sent him texts a few of the times that I woke up, just general ""I love you"" ""please dont give up on me"" ""I miss you"" or a compliment etc and I feel like I'm being so clingy but its also reassuring that he'll see all those when he wakes up... Its 8:12am so sorry if I fall asleep... Its going to be a long day

I guess I just needed to get it off my chest and ask, is there any tips you guys have for me when I speak to my mum about it to make her see I really do need this and how can I get the bf to believe that I *can* get better? Ive already started working on being more positive and communicating my thoughts/feelings to my boyfriend when I'm down and such (it often doesnt work because I'm horrible at articulating things when I'm upset and especially hard if its out loud as opposed to typing, but i feel I am getting better) all the while this little voice of depression is telling me I dont deserve him

For the record I am 18f, bf is 19m, my dad has had depression since before he met my mum (and it seems to run in his family) so shes been dealing with him for almost 25 years, I dont understand why she would almost ignore me having it if she knows the distruction it can cause. I cant get to the doctors unless she drives me so I really really need her onboard here, for the sake of everything I love and everyone who cares about me, I havent self harmed in almost a year but its getting so difficult to stop myself... I still havent given in to it yet though! Please Reddit, I need your help


**Edit**: more details/rearranging/spell checking

**Edit 2**: When me and my bf had the talk last night it was when he got in from his friends birthday party (around maybe 2am?) where they were drinking, he was also very very tired, I'm not sure whether he remembers the conversation because he didnt mention it and seemed fine when we were chatting this morning I did bring something from yesterday afternoon up to try and smooth it over and apologise because it was a stupid thing for me to get upset at and he did seem to get a bit quiet after that and has disappeared for about an hour now (though I'm pretty sure he just fell asleep) I'm not sure whether to bring up some of the stuff he said yesterday because it hurt and after he said it I promised Id try my best to get better and things, I dont know if he remembers them and honestly, I dont really want to remember them myself but I know we also need to communicate our feelings more too


#**Final Edit**: 

I spoke to my mum while we were out and she said I just need to get out the house more etc, as we were talking I recieved this text from my boyfriend and collapsed in the street, I've spent the past hour or so crying with my mum trying to console me, I dont really know what to do from here other than take her advice, theres nothing I can do...

""*And it's great that you're going to start making an effort to get help and stuff, but I just don't feel like my hearts in it any more.... I realised yesterday when you were crying and I just sat there watching.... Usually I'd cry too, right? But I didn't... I didn't feel anything... I'm numb and I feel like it's for the best if I just end it because I've been in this situation before and it never gets better... All staying with you is going to do is bring us both down even more... I want to be alone for a while and I'm so, so sorry... But this is what I want.... I hope you can forgive me one day... But I feel like this is for the best because otherwise I'm just going to get worse and that won't be good for either of us*""",depression,t5_2qqqf,I dont know what to do and I really need your help

I'll try this again. Once more. Maybe this time. Maybe. Another rant on the internet. Another post to be lost. 

I can't even get my thoughts organised. I'm randomly typing whatever comes to my mind.

I feel I'll not be happy, whatever I get. I've become so cynical. This is not to say there aren't nice people around me.
I just feel fed up of trying to have happiness in any way.

I don't feel happy. Just don't. I feel sort of annoyed with everything in general. 
I've had passions about things, wanted to try new things, but it seems everything falls apart. But now, no activity seems to give me happiness. It's like a chronic pain which will never let me be happy.

I did things I could do. I went to the gym, lost 12kgs, got fit, read good books, spoke to people, watched good movies, improved my grades. These are some of the things I appreciate I've done. Progress towards your ideal beautiful, right life in the right spiritual path.
But. Everything seems exhausted now. Like it's hit a brick wall. Like. There's no amount of grades, fitness, shopping, books, motivation that will help me. I wish I could put this more into perspective. 

Read motivation over the internet, felt boosted for two days, fall back again. Talked to someone, got appreciated by someone, but it all seems to hit back to square one again. Meditated, thought this was the way, looking at life in the equanimous way, and I'll be okay. 

None of this is to say I haven't improved, or things aren't better. I've worked hard, it gave me good results. But that was all to it. Something still seems wrong. It sort of crumbles apart the more I think of it. I've realised I'm the happiest when I'm ignoring how things really are. Not thinking about things at all. But I don't stop thinking. And there are unanswered questions, some agitation that is always lingering. 

I've even been to Vipassana, never put on a schedule. It always felt apart after a few days. 

I wanted to try psychedelics, really did, not for euphoria but because most people gave reports of positive life changing experiences after them. Never could find any. Yes, I did also consider the risk how they could mess my head up as well.

I've observed. There's a separation of the emotional and intellectual mind. You'll agree to it intellectually, you need to focus on the now, not take things personally because everyone is looking at life from their own window, how nothing matters cause it's just a ride, nothing really matters any way, we are beautiful chunks of the universe experiencing itself and etcetera, but it doesn't hit you emotionally. I'll try being my own foster parent, I'll try making the most continuous streaks to build up a new habit, I'll try to meditate by beginning with 'just' two minutes a day, I am the only one who can help me. All the wisdom you could get. It'll loom in my head for a few days, the fact I've found the solution to my troubles, I'll try once perhaps, forget and be the same again. 
 I don't know. Nothing is working. I couldn't do anything at all. I have added no good habits. No movement towards feeling okay again.

What I feel is a desire to shut everything down, not by killing myself, but just sleep and not wake up again. I feel a certain physical heaviness in my body and have a very strong wish to get away from the weight and limit of this body. I could say the same for my mind as well. Like just separating from this weight upon me. Of my thoughts, of all the things I have to deal with. 

Whenever I sleep during the day I wake up as if I was almost dying and everything was ending and it's sad and emotionally shaking to put it simply. This doesn't happen when I sleep during the night. I feel someone else could just take my body and life and live well with it. But there's also my attachment to myself, to me, my ego, how right and how apparently desirable I am to my own self.

I'll also put in some background on myself. I'm in college. Medical college. I was very close to my schizophrenic/bipolar mother who is now long gone and lives in another city and I have no communication with her. Frankly she was a very positive influence in my life, and it was a very messed up situation. I was only 13 then. I didn't miss her then, perhaps the denial stage of grief. I miss how everything was okay back then. I didn't have a chronic issue in my head, something I know I'll have to deal when I go back home each day. 
I don't know what mental health issues I actually have, if I actually have something called 'depression', or is there an explanation for my very fluctuating mood, my two different personalities people see and deal with, whether I am whatever I try to be. I am a medical student and understand what things are possible, although I don't and can't diagnose myself. I also read spiritual things, and all I get is a mish mash of huge confusion about what things really are like in reality, or if not real how to deal with them.
I try to help people when I can, be nice, but my mood is so weird I can hurt people a lot, just to justify my own hurt. I feel I have nothing of my own left, all of me is ideas put in by other people, things other people find cool/right, society finds is right. But maybe it's like discipline, pushing you towards something better, you can't find all the right things on your own. 
I have tried to put in as much as I can, distressing events make me write all about them, hoping someone will know exactly what to do about this exact situation. Maybe I need an explanation, I don't want to blame myself. Maybe I like to torture my own self. I don't even know, I feel so messed. 

I've put in so much of my head, and I wish someone would help, really do.
Thank you for the trouble of having read all this, if you did.",depression,t5_2qqqf,I need some help.

It really set me back because it felt like she didn't want to acknowledge my concerns and I felt completely stupid. I mentioned it again today because over the past month I've spiraled deeper than ever before and she said basically the same thing.

I need to write here again, because I've had some things cluttering my mind lately.

First there's this thing that I noticed last week, and it's that I can't feel any emotions anymore. At first I noticed it when my aunt asked if I wanted to become her daughter's ""godfather"" (even though she will not be baptized nor do I belong into any church). Now, I've almost always wanted to be a godfather for some asinine reason; maybe I want to be a mafioso. Anyway, I felt nothing. I wasn't happy that she thought of me as a fitting candidate, I didn't feel like I was being honored with this position; absolutely nothing.

And now, after I've thought about this apathy, I noticed I didn't feel anything when my mother accused me of using ""mental"" or ""psychical"" violence against her earlier last week. This particular confrontation came after I told her how bad I've been feeling lately, and how both she and my father don't really understand anything. When she started screaming all these accusations, I really didn't feel anything again. One thing she said was that I'm apparently terribly self-centered, an accusation which actually poked some vestige of an emotion, but it was more of a memory of things past than a real emotional response I think.

--

Another thing (which might contradict the previous a bit) that I realized just this morning is that I am terribly afraid of women. Not in a ""classical"" sense, but rather of falling in love. It is a horrible paradox, when my closest friend is a lovely young woman, for whom I had completely fallen many years past, an awkward part of our lives that we have put behind us since. Or rather I've tried to forget about those feelings. But I can't. Should I spend too much time with her, I get terribly depressed and can't deal with anything. Then I turn to look at my other friends, but to no avail: either they are guys to whom I can't talk to about these things out of shame and having spent the last six years talking about the same problems all the time; or they are even more beautiful women who either think of me as *a really good friend* or are in a relationship already.

So I really don't see a way how I can get out of this predicament without losing those female friends.

I just completely hate my life. Wherever I look I see happy, beautiful people. I'm constantly lonely, even when I'm with friends. I don't sleep, I don't eat, I'm physically ill, and most likely dying soon on account of my diabetes.",depression,t5_2qqqf,Inability to feel (and more)

I am 21 and have been in therapy since I was 12. I have seen countless counselors (LPCs), social workers (LCSWs), and psychologists (phD). My best experience has been with a psychologist whom I saw for 4 years. She was extremely knowledgeable and helpful. She really understood my conditions (I'm diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder, Panic Disorder, and Borderline Personality Disorder). My psychologist was the only therapist I ever saw that truly understood my BPD. She gave me real life solutions that actually helped. However, the LPCs (counselors) and LCSWs (Social Workers) who I've seen have generally conducted more ""talk therapy"" with less solutions and more of me just talking about my problems.

I had to stop seeing my psychologist due to insurance reasons. Now, my insurance will only cover counselors and social workers. I've been seeing a new social worker for the past few weeks, and I've been having a hard time letting go of my bias towards social workers. This social worker seems to be much more knowledgable than the other ones I have experience with. But during my last therapy session, she said something that didn't click with me. Maybe it was just a misunderstanding on my part. I will ask her to clarify what she meant the next time we meet.

I just wanted to hear others experiences. Maybe I have just had really bad luck with social workers and counselors in the past. Is it just me? I'm desperately hoping someone can tell me that they've had good experiences with social workers and counselors. I can't get the idea out of my mind that psychologists are the best therapists. The psychologist I saw for 4 years was the only good experience I ever had with a therapist. And I've mostly had negative experiences with counselors and social workers. Any advice?

We were just given a brand new, fancy-looking, Gevalia coffee maker that replaced our beat, 10-year-old cheap one. I liked seeing it on the counter and it worked well. Well, it's a little different in function from our old one and because I handled it incorrectly, today, I accidentally knocked the carafe off the counter. It shattered on the floor. Instantly, the self-loathing began along with that voice in my head telling me what and idiot I am. My rational brain knows it was just a simple accident that could've happened to anyone but I just can't let myself off the hook. My mood is ruined and I am just beating-up on myself in a constant stream in my head. 

I search the basement and find another, older carafe and feel a little better. I go upstairs and get it set to brew again but I quickly find this carafe doesn't fit right and won't along the maker to work. Ok, so now I have also wasted a pot's worth of coffee grounds and feel like and even bigger loser because I didn't figure it out before starting this pot.  I am sinking lower and lower and hating myself more and more because I am convinced that I am stupid and a idiot. 

I dig up the coffee maker that came with the second carafe. It is older and not so cool and new looking but it works. Now, I have coffee brewing but I sit here hating myself for fucking up and dreading my wife getting up. I know she will ask what happened when she sees the older maker on the counter. I know she won't call me names or insult me like I am doing to myself but I know I will get a frown or an ""oh, great"" and I am so fearful of that disdain. 

This is all fixable. I know I can order a new carafe and in a few days all will be back to how it was. That doesn't change all this self-hate and dark mood I feel now. Why do I have to be like this? It really isn't a big, fucking deal. I just made a mistake but, god, I feel like a just murdered a grandma and a bagful of kittens.

Other great news: replacement carafes not available for this model. Hating myself even more. Loser.

Today I was having a more difficult time than I normally do and began convincing myself that it wasn't rape, but I was just experiencing extreme sexual regret, something the school tried telling me I was experiencing when I tried reporting my rape. Schools do that apparently. Fuckers. 


So I was sobbing in my room trying to tell myself that I made a rape out of sexual regret, trying to tell myself I shouldn't bother pursuing things legally, trying to tell myself I'm overreacting and being dramatic. I was screaming at myself in my mind for being a dumb fucked up cunt and a slut and a liar. I focused venomous thoughts on myself. I cried until I was forced to stop had to focus on not throwing up. 


Now I feel so empty inside and disappointed in the world that keeps throwing more and more shit at me, thinking I can keep taking it. I can't. I can't because I already relive my rape at least once a day, my nights are sleepless and riddled with nightmares, I shake violently when I hear a car that sounds like his, and I'm so depressed that I have to force myself out of bed every day. It really fucking sucks.


More than anything, I miss the old me. The pre-rape me. On days like today my heart breaks thinking of the person I once was and how I'm barely a shadow of her. I really liked me. I didn't despise me then like I despise the new me. I think she's worthless and disgusting. I think she's a horrible person and that's why things aren't getting better for her.

He has saved me in more ways than one and has held my hand and cared for me through all of this. What do I do to return his kindness and patience? I push him away on my bad days and purposely try to hurt him so he won't want to take care of me anymore. What the hell is wrong with me?

I just want to get better so badly. My good days are amazing but my bad days are terrible and turn me into this out-of-control sobbing mess. But I was raped less than a year ago.

I've been depressed the entirety of my life, and when I say entirety, I literally mean the whole thing. Was I a happy kid? No. I was always on guard. Lots of abuse of all types from many different people. My sister said that I threatened to commit suicide (I worded it ""kill myself) ""way before"" I ""was seven."" I don't remember it. I also don't think I knew what suicide was, but I believe her. 

The last two years have been the absolute worst. I don't want to get into specific details because I don't think it actually matters. I know all of us have problems.

I started this medication, that medication, nothing was working. Until recently I cut out my ""night medication"" and suddenly the sun is shining and I can appreciate a warm breeze. I'm excited to go on vacation and I have the energy to return phone calls and get out of bed. I can get out of bed!!!

This week I went to my boyfriend's softball game. Something that would have caused SO MUCH anxiety and fear. Something I would have avoided. He hit two home runs! He was so excited for me to be there. I knew it meant a lot to him and it meant a lot to me. There was an unspoken victory... that had nothing to do with home runs.

Over twenty years. Twenty years of suicidal thoughts, twenty years of heart wrenching sadness. My entire cognizant life. 

Of course there were ups and downs. There were highlights and good memories. I want to tell you what I think helped me.

Three months ago life was literally so dark I wouldn't get out of bed for a week straight. My boyfriend would order me delivery; otherwise I wouldn't eat. I dropped off the face of the planet for whatever friends I did have left.

- I got rid of all of the unsupportive assholes in my life: this includes my mom, dad, sisters... all of them. 

- I had to be more reliant on good people. The people I chose to keep around. They were really rooting for me. The difference in good v. bad is amazing. 

- I saw my therapist religiously. Sometimes two, three times a week. I can not convey, enough, how instrumental he has been in my recovery.

- I learned how to build boundaries, say no. (Before I would always say yes, go out of my way to do something for someone or completely fail at doing it for them... then feel bad about it.)

- I learned how to speak up for myself instead of turning inward (up until recently, I suffered from PTSD and present day Amnesia. When I was ""triggered"" I became frozen, physically immobilized. I would forget the time during and proceeding that. I didn't even know I did that until last year, when my at the time boyfriend would get mad at me for ""pretending not to remember a fight."") 

- I got an emotional support animal. She's amazing and I rely on her heavily. 

- I am more patient, I am more observant. I have some sort of humor now about how bizarre and untrustworthy people can be. I've learned to rely on myself and be sparing about the details I give.

I know I'll have ups and downs. I'm not even feeling particularly great right now - but I know what I'm not feeling... I'm not feeling like I'm waiting for my life to end. 

I just wanted to share with you guys that... even for a girl like me... there's hope. 

Although if you told me that three months ago, I would have told you to go fuck yourself.

I turned 20. I didn't really think about it until now, but I am not where I wanted to be at 20 at all. I'm an academic failure, I can't hold a job because I can never adapt and I wind up crying in the bathroom, thinking about killing myself, and then quitting.

I was supposed to be in my third year for a BS in Software Engineering. I was supposed to have a job on the side. I'm a kissless, handholdless, relationshipless virgin. I've never even had a close female friend. I just seize up when I'm around any girl I find moderately attractive, which happens a lot since I become infatuated with every girl that shows me some modicum of human decency and respect. I can't saddle somebody with that kind of emotional baggage. That's unreasonable. But at the same time I don't know if I can focus on my other problems, the ones that make me unattractive, when I'm distracted by this gigantic feeling of being unworthy. I can't help but feel that I'm going to die alone and unloved, which makes giving a fuck about anything really, really hard.

I'm just inadequate. I can't function in this society. I want to kill myself but my instinct to survive is too strong. Too bad my instinct to reproduce is so stunted.

That's the other thing, I don't even really want a girlfriend for the sex. At least, not the sex alone. It's the affection I crave. The validation. Somebody who loves me even though I can't love myself. I keep telling myself I'll try to find a job, or that I'll exercise, or that I'll start eating right, or that I'll go to sleep on time, or even just that I'll remember to brush my teeth every day, but I never do. I never have the energy to. I've suffered through constant self-doubt for five years now. No wait, six. Six years. Six years of only ever feeling ""okay"" for extended periods of time. Six years of occasionally getting really pumped and excited followed by apathy and then intense self-loathing. And even when I'm pumped and excited, it's always about something or somebody *else.* The only times I feel good are the times when I feel my self-image isn't as important. Sometimes I escape the self-loathing, but it's merely an absence of hatred, not a presence of love.

I don't even know why I hate myself, I just do. Just for being me. There's nothing I could ever do to lift the hatred. There's no condition to fulfill to earn my own love. Love is for other people, not for me. When my family tells me they love me I feel awkward and fake. When other people give me compliments, I compulsively brush them off. I take them apart and make up reasons for them to be sarcastic or products of pity. ""She's only saying that to be nice."" ""He only said that because there were other people around."" ""I bet he was thinking the exact opposite.""

For some reason I only ever see the bad in myself. My counselor wants me to write down ""islands of competence,"" things that I'm good at. I can't think of any. I try, and I try, but I can't think of any other than my intelligence, which makes me feel like a twat, and I'm not even really sure I'm all that smart. I mean, sure, I've got a high-average WAIS-IV score, but I got a 76 on computational speed. Freaking 76.

I've been taking Citalapram, or Celexa, for about four years. I'm only taking 10mg, the lowest dosage, but I still get bad symptoms when I go without it. I've tried to stop taking it before, but it didn't work out. I wanted to go to my doctor to get advice on getting off of the medication, but they said the doctor won't be available for months for an appointment, and that the office probably won't give me any more citalopram because I was supposed to have been out of it 2 months ago (because I had tried to take it every other day before). 
So now I have to do get off of it on my own. I just feel like It's going to be so hard to handle this. I'm already really depressed. Right now, I have 4 pills left. So I'm just wondering if anyone has any advice on what the best way is to deal with coming off this medication and dealing with the symptoms and the depression that is to come. I'm already depressed now, but I just feel like it's going to get worse once I'm off this medication.

A nervous breakdown that barely escaped hospitalization - combined with 9 months on psych leave from school - pretty much destroyed (in my mind) any chance I have in academia. While I loved what I studied and want to go back, I don't even think it's worthwhile since I feel I can't get into a good enough program to justify the expense or deal with all the stress and depression I now associate with school. 



Since graduating I've been working part time, now up to three jobs and still unable to support myself and live independently of my parents, while classmates and friends are getting into Cambridge programs and jobs at the FBI. I feel like I wasted my degree and my money and left school with no job prospects but a lot of suicidal thoughts. 



I have 14 hour days that I don't know how I get through and don't know if I can physically or mentally continue. I get serious depression triggered by job hunting, the most recent example being about three days where I can barely remember other than the feeling I deserved and needed to die. I retail binge and shop compulsively to help deal with this (I get a happy high when buying something, and then when I get home feel too tired/unenthused to actually use or enjoy the thing I bought). A friend is helping me look for work but I have a barrier to applying; I freeze up mentally and start to panic when I see postings, and then end up for hours or days in depressive fugue. 




My family can be very toxic - my mother has severe anxiety that feeds and triggers my own and is averse to psychotherapy and medication - but is otherwise supportive. I was seeing someone regularly for three years, plus medication, but had to stop due to moving back home and insurance refusing to pay us. While I've started seeing someone new, she has told me she doesn't believe in medication and all therapy should be done holistically, which makes me uncomfortable. I'm not taking any medication any more (out of a combination of pride, my parents disliking the medication to begin with, not feeling like it did anything in the first place, and having no new psychiatrist to prescribe it).

I wasn't successful at all during this time.  I also asked a stupid amount of girls out and couldn't even pull off a date.  I was about to give up when I met a girl.

Got dumped out of the blue and last time this happened, I got severely depressed (too depressed to have the energy to even attempt suicide) then became manic with paranoia for about a month and a half or so and was in PHP, then became depressed again, suicidal thoughts came back, hospitalized twice. Drinking and drug use got out of control. Went into rehab. 

Lately, I've been very stable, even without meds but again got dumped out of the blue. The night it happened, I experienced something worse than a panic attack. I think I was hallucinating (hearing a tapping on my window) but I'll never know for sure but I was definitely delusional and was seeing very violent images in my head. I thought I had hurt someone and was going to turn myself in. The following day, I was no longer thinking this way but I was going to try to commit suicide. 

That all subsided but I'm worried how I'll be longer term or if the weird psychosis type thing will happen again. I'm actually terrified it might happen again... The soonest appointment I got with a psychiatrist is for September 12th. However, I could get a free assessment from a psychiatric hospital. I'd just rather not have to do that. Should I wait a month and a half to see a doctor or does this sound like something I should talk to someone immediately about? I told my therapist about the psychosis-like thingy but not the suicidal thoughts. ",BipolarReddit,t5_2qzru,How urgent is my situation?

I used to shock myself into trying life again after each bad binge-eating episode (Maybe the analogy for you guys is Netflix marathons). I would set plans. Go exercise. But I keep falling back into the darkness, and I feel like it's easier to just give in to the slide.

I got a job 6 weeks ago. I quit last morning. 

I quit caffeine and alcohol around 6 weeks ago, so that I'm not confusing my emotional states (major highs, major crashes), but recently, I started drinking again. Both alcohol and caffeine. They make me feel alive for an hour or two. After binge-eating today, I had some coffee and decided to pick up a book to sharpen my skill at a hobby. I got in my car and drove aggressively but happily, almost like saying, ""Excuse me, other bitches on the road. But I got somewhere important to go."" Feels good. Because for a rare moment, I had an important goal in life. Of course, this motivation dissolves after an hour.

I put off sleep as much as possible. (""Why bother going to sleep? Rest for what?""). So I've become a zombie.

While I binge-eat chocolate between meals, I still choose healthy meals...until today. I pigged out today on unhealthy meals not because I enjoy them, but almost just out of a sense of curiosity to see if they would stimulate me. (""What's the point in getting that salad? You will cancel it with ice cream anyways. Let’s just experiment with a double cheeseburger and fries for breakfast"")

I used to be stingy with money. I gave up on that as well. Fuck it, I need my chocolate and ice cream. Used to feel good about regulating my spending. Made me feel responsible. Responsibility used to be a ""rush."" I no longer feel this rush. (""Oh good for me, I am being responsible. Yeah, what for?"")

I stopped socializing. People just frustrate me with their inability to empathize. All they do is come up with trite, superficial advice. ""Keep trying!""

I didn't exercise today. I am afraid I will stop exercising as well.

I used to have all these controls, these disciplines, these habits to stay grounded. But they're all dropping like flies.

So... what do you guys think? What's the point of trying? Of fighting to stay in this world? Especially when it costs so much effort and gives so little reward...and you inevitably end up in your depressive spiral at the end of the day anyways... What's the freakin point? 

I really feel like this is the end. I'm not sure what that means. It's like I am finished with life maintenance. All my good habits are crumbling, and I'm letting them crumble because at this point, nothing I try helps, so it really seems irrational and silly to “keep up” with good habits, when they ultimately don’t do jack shit.

It started last summer, my girlfriend and I were planning on moving to a new city to go to school together. Then I found out she was cheating on me with a girl from the UK and I couldn't bring myself to move with her for the course. All this on top of the fact that my bitch mother would constantly scream at me for not being good enough, being lazy and unmotivated, which is hard to overcome when you just lost the love of your life and your hopes for the future. 

I couldn't take it. I moved out using the money I had saved up for school. I had been working for Walmart for a year and a half by this point, probably the most degrading and dream crushing job you could imagine. I met  a lot of people who I considered good friends, but I guess they obviously felt different, as most (read:all) of them I dont talk to anymore. The most prominent being a man in his thirties, who I admit I was severely attracted to, and we hit it off, sparking a semi-relationship, if you could even call it that.

Fast forward a while and work had been causing tensions in my life, I was put on the night shift and it soon took a toll on my mental and physical health. My managers were pushing me to the limit, promising me a higher position and more pay if I kept working this hard... but it never came. I quit after I had a mini breakdown on the staff washroom, I couldnt even muster up the strength to put in a 2 week notice, which may have screwed me over in the long run as I have no solid references or networking now.

Now I'm currently four months into unemployment. The only friends I once had have moved away to college and I am completely alone save for my roommate and my grandparents who I visit regularly. I have been so lonely that I've even begun online dating, which led me to find a few fairly attractive men who appear to be at the very least interested in me sexually. Not willing to make any sort of commitment, of course. I'm not relationship material I guess, just a free ride on the pussy wagon. 

And that man I had mentioned a while back? We reconnected after we both left the company. I had assumed he had at least valued my friendship, or wanted a girlfriend but it turns out he was just looking to use me as a personal sex toy. This has been almost the suicide point for me. The one person living in this city who I have a connection with and it turns out they're just using me. Ouch.

All this on top of the tons of resumes Ive sent out in the nearest 30 km from where I live, and the fact that I have not even got ONE RESPONSE from a single employer, not even for a fucking dishwashing position at the retirement home down the street. I dont know what I'm going to do. I only have enough money for TWO months rent, I think when that dries up I'll just jump in front of a train, god knows Ive already planned it out in my head.

Good luck to all of you, I hope it works out and you can find happiness in your lives. Im going to hold out as long as I can before I pull the plug on myself...",depression,t5_2qqqf,I'm trapped.

During that period of feeling motivated, my performance at work/school increased drastically, as did my ability to socialize with others. It was also then that I would develop these certain grandiose 'thoughts'.

Among other thoughts I do not wish to share publicly right now, I believed I could read minds, see the future, change the course of events, stuff like that. These beliefs grew in intensity as the days went by, and a confirmation bias when my predictions were right only served to fuel them. Grandiose beliefs like these would appear once or twice a year or so. Until recently, I thought of it as nothing but Asperger's, which I was diagnosed with at the time.

As years went on, these manic periods would end more weirdly. When I was 16, I started having recurring dreams about torturing and killing people, and I ended up cutting myself, writing words into my upper arm where no one would see it. The self-harm became a thing that I would do just before falling back into depression.

I got caught last year when I was 19, my parents sent me to the hospital after I tried hanging myself. Sent to a therapist twice a week, they talked about bipolar being a factor for this behavior, but I denied it, was then given a script for lamictal, and the bipolar was never brought up again.

After doing some more research on BP, I realized that during these episodes, I was completely delusional. I thought I was thinking normal thoughts at the time.

We understand that some of you want to talk about your feelings in the context of these events, but that can be extremely triggering to others, so we encourage you to do your sharing in another subreddit.~~  

So, in the urgency to deal with the huge onslaught of wildly inappropriate posts yesterday, I didn't word this very well.  I'm not going to remove the text that garnered all the hate, but here's an attempt to clarify our policy.

There's no prohibition on mentioning or discussing a current event, but this is a depression support forum.  That means:

 *  If you've come here, or if you've been hanging around here for a while, because you're depressed, you are welcome to talk about *whatever* is weighing on your mind.  Same goes if you're worried about someone in your life who's depressed.  

 * If you were *not* struggling with depression, but came here in response to a current event, this is probably not the right place.

We were inundated with a large volume of posts yesterday from people who had no history with this community, and (manifestly) no idea what it's like to be *really* depressed.  We also had some conversations whose main focus was not support but some combination of tribute, morbid voyeurism, and philosophical/sociological debate. This reminder was directed at them, not at anyone with a real need for what we try our best to provide.

It's something that hurts that's so beyond the outside world and it just infuriates me to think that people think that being loved should snap you out of it. That's not how depression works.

In the past few years my depression has been deep and desolate. I don’t have a bad life: I have a kind family, a decent job, no financial problems, no major issues. There is no devastating event that should delve me into the throes of depression. And that’s what these reporters don’t get. When you feel that urge to end it, it’s not something that you feel is in your control.

There was a time that I genuinely felt that urge. I was taking a walk on a busy street and I felt nothing in my body. It wasn’t even sadness. It wasn’t like I was having a crappy day or I was upset about something. It wasn’t being really super bummed–it was an overwhelming sense of absolutely nothing and the horrifying feeling that I would never feel anything again. It’s not an emotion, it’s an emptiness that makes every step feel useless. There is no future because there is nothing. And that’s when I had the thought: “If I jump in front of that car, I don’t have to feel this anymore.”

And there was a sense of peace about that. It wasn’t some sense of cowardice to feel that emotion. I wasn’t thinking of anyone else because when you feel the drain of such depression you literally can’t. I love my family more than anything in this world, but I wasn’t capable of thinking of them in that moment. It’s an urge that feels so powerful and it has nothing to do with who you are or who loves you. Robin Williams is not a coward or selfish.

I have been unable to leave my flat wearing stuff I want to, i.e more female feminine stuff and if I do leave it’s in jeans and a t-shirt which make me more depressed as I feel I have given in and just decided to hide myself from the world. Which I suppose is because that’s what I’m doing.

I have little to no self-confidence or self-worth. I'm an incredibly lonely, shy, sometimes angry person. I'm shallow, I'm cynical, and I'm a bunch of other adjectives I don't have time to list. I recently started college and I'm already feeling completely left out, hopeless and alone. I recently made a post in r/introvert that essentially explains my situation from an ""I want friends"" viewpoint [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/introvert/comments/2dcpe8/my_fellow_introverts_i_need_help_im_a_new_college/) (it's quite long). I discovered this subreddit today when it was trending and figured I would give you guys a try. Bear with me. I'm really emotional.

***I am the reason for my own unhappiness.*** I realize that. I hate that. But it's true. I place walls around myself that prevent me from enjoying life and having fun. I'm lonely because I never leave my dorm room except to go to class. I don't leave because I'm too scared to talk to people. When I go to eat, I desperately avoid other people if I don't immediately see someone I know and sit by myself. When other people come over and ask if I want to join them, I get angry (but politely decline on the outside). I have no love for myself and thus it's impossible for others to love me. I don't know why anyone would want to love me. I find it almost impossible that anyone could like me as a human being.

Maybe I'm being extreme. Today was a particularly awful day. I went to class, immediately came back to the dorm, thought about ""A"" (see my other post in r/Introvert), realized I would never have her, did some laundry, locked myself out of my dorm, waited for an eternity for the DPS to arrive and unlock it (all the while politely declining peoples' invitations to join them in their rooms while I waited), then once someone finally unlocked it I went into my room, got under my bed and slept. I woke up, went to dinner (dreading social contact), and made a beeline for an empty table. I finished lunch all the while listening to everyone else being happy and sociable around me, then came back to my dorm to lock myself inside.

I'm not full blown depressed. I have good days and bad days. I've actually been fairly happy for the past several months until recently. Around the time I left for college (a little under a week ago) I've just not felt any real joy. Life seems like more of a chore than a fun experience. My greatest hobby, video games, no longer appeal to me. I've just spent my days wasting away in my dorm. I want to go out, but I just can't. After all, nobody wants to be around me anyway. It's for the greater good that I avoid people. That's what I keep telling myself.

I've gone on long enough about this. Sorry for complaining and taking up space, but even if nobody reads this it helps to write it down and get it out.

Added a little more detail, my parents would beat me with boards, electrical cords, belt buckles, wet rags in the bathtub, ruptured muscles in my left leg, set me on fire as they held my hands over stove burners. When asked how my parents treated me I would explain in detail but try to throw some humor in to relief the seriousness of the topic. 

But now (about 6 months now) I've been having flashbacks, like screaming and crying when I sleep. Or daydreaming and feel welts or soreness or burning on my skin. I also have a serious back injury that I suffered over two years ago that finally got diagnosed correctly that my discs within my spine from s1 to l4 are bone on bone that I take pain medication for. I take Percocet, Lyrica, ibuprofen for pain and celexa and Xanax for depression and panic attacks. 

To explain my depression, I always want people to be happy and I dismiss my problems and focus on others. When asked about myself I say I'm fine or its nothing to worry about. I have bad mood swings where I can't stand to be around people. If I'm around alot of people, I start to have panic attacks. Where pressure like a wide rubber band is around my forehead and temples and then also just above my teeth below my nose. The panic attacks make it as if I don't feel below my knees and the someone is placing pressure right under the back of my skull. If it so severe, I have to go home a remove almost all my clothing, rings, watch and ball cap. I've tried to control this and seek help but I've gotten no where. 

Now, I feel like I need to get away. I feel like I need to stop this on my own. My wife and kids don't understand or I blow off what they say. Due to my back injury, I've not been able to work. I've applied for disability but have been turned down twice, we're going to lose our home. I'm just a bundle of joy coming to post ain't I? But I want it all to stop, I want the flashbacks, the pain and the failure to stop, I want it to end. I've saved money up for a cremation and set a will to have my ashes thrown away or disposed of.

Little bit about myself. 21 year old male; currently going to school part time while working full time; living with my parents, but I'm okay with that and so are they; have a girlfriend, but only been seeing her for a few weeks now, so nothing too serious yet; have a car, a good circle of friends, no traumatizing incidents that I'm aware of, and no family history of mental illness.

I read the above info and think I should be just swell. It sounds like the average 21 year old to me, and I would think being in as decent a situation as I'm in, I should be happy. But I'm not. I hardly ever am anymore.

I can't really point to when I started feeling like this. My best estimate would probably be around August of last year. At first, I didn't really notice it. Now, a year later, and I just feel so... hopeless. I feel no motivation to do anything anymore. I still go to work, but only because I need the money. I'm hanging out with my friends less often, I'm not doing the things I like to do anymore due to lack of interest, and even after I finally worked up the courage to ask my crush out to a date and now we're actually a couple, I don't feel any happier than before.

I'm just... scared. Scared is the best way to put it. I'm sad, I don't know why, and it's frightening me. Sometimes, I come home from work, and it doesn't even matter if I had a good or a bad day; I just crash. I lock myself in my room, sit on my bed and just... cry. It doesn't happen every night, but going from ""never crying ever"" to ""crying almost every other night"" is extremely worrying to me. 

It's especially worrying because, as I've said, I should be happy. A lot of times, when I read about or talk to people with depression, it's usually due to terrible living conditions, or some kind of personal trauma experienced. I don't have any of that... and yet I still feel awful. It only makes things worse, because then I feel like I'm being ungrateful... like my brain is scolding me, saying ""How dare you feel sad? You have a great life! Stop being such a big baby and suck it up, wimp!""

I don't know what to do anymore. I'm failing my college classes because I just don't care anymore. I've almost given up on my hobbies and passions because I've lost the motivation to do them. Hanging out with friends provides a temporary fix, but even then it sometimes doesn't help. Sorry if this seems kind of rant-ey... I just feel so awful right now. No one in my family has ever had any kind of depression, as far as I'm aware, and for some reason I can't really explain, I'm too scared to tell my parents of how I feel. I just put on a happy face and pretend like nothing's wrong whenever they're around. Only two of my friends actually know about how I feel... the rest remain blissfully unaware, and I don't want to tell them. I started going to therapy, paying out of pocket, but it's far too early to see if that will help. I just don't know what to do anymore...

I am not even sure of the reason for this post. Maybe I just need to get some of this out of my head. 

I am in so much pain. Day and night, it's constant. Sometimes the emotional pain, flashbacks and nightmares give me physical pain too. Sometimes I inflict pain on myself with self harm to just try to get some relief. I am tortured with my past and reliving it over and over again. I have lost everything over this last year. I don't recognize myself at all and just feel dead inside and broken. 

My therapists are both unavailable till close to September, I tried to see my primary care doctor this morning to get some help for my nightmares since I am not sleeping, but I can't see her until next Tuesday. I feel so lost and beat down.

(again not going to do anything today) I didn't want to post this to suicidewatch because this belongs here more than anywhere else. I have PTSD & if it was a legit diagnosis C-PTSD. I have been surviving it for about a year and just recently have been trying to do something about it. I want to die!  Every day, but especially every night. I don't feel like I have any kind of future and have so much trouble finding reasons to keep going and putting myself through this hell every day. It is relentless and will not give up. It is crushing me, suffocating me. I'm drowning. I have one reason, one incredible reason, that has kept me here. When he is with me I feel strong, loved and safe, but when he isn't I feel extremely vulnerable and alone.

My story started the month before my senior year ended. I was getting nervous of what I was gonna do after high school and I decided one day to look into the army because I knew I could leave this city and go do something. I went to a recruiter and it felt good, I knew that's what I wanted to do. They gave me a practice ASVAP and I got a 40 on it. The recruiter said that was good and that I should get like 10 points higher on the real one.  A week later, I was down at the MEPS office and what do you know,  I got 10 higher.  I was happy because I thought I was close to my future.  I go back to the recruiter office and he says I need to lose some weight, around 10 pounds, I agree. I start running daily, limiting myself to around 30g of carbs per day and by the next week or so I had lost 10 pounds. I had gone from 183 to around 174 or just about.  He said I should be ready for the physical to see if I had anything wrong and if I was healthy to join. I end up going and everything is good until we had this packet that asked if we ever got suspended from school or anything.  I didn't put anything at 1st but then I thought to myself ""what if they catch that I'm lying"" and I got so nervous I asked for a pen back. I wrote down that I go a 30 day suspension for dealing and a 1 day suspension for like something dumb. After that part we had the actual physical and the doctor told me if I had taken any medication in the last 2 days. I told him I had taken fat burners and he told me I would get a temp dq. After that and some other tests I was done for the day. I told my recruiter what had happened and he has upset. He said I had to go again next week to take another drug test or somethin and I did. After the drug test they told me I had failed the TAPAS so I had to come in next week to do that.   So next week comes and the day of, I text my recruiter telling him that I'm coming to the office but I get no response.  Weird, so I tell my dad to drive me up there and that I'll call him later when I'm done.  I get to the office and my recruiter sees me, and the face he made was like an ""ah shit face"". I say hey what's up when are we going to MEPS,  and he asks if I drove here and if I didn't to call whoever did back to me. He sits me down and says that the army counted my 30 day suspension as a felony because I got a punishment but he said it wasn't on my record. He said he had gotten off the phone with one of his higher ups to see if there was anything they could do about it but he said there was nothing left to do. He said sorry and that maybe it wasn't meant to be. Right then and there my heart sank and I felt like the biggest piece of shit I had ever felt in my life.  I left with my dad and he said ""hey don't feel discouraged"" and I started tearing up.  I was so angry at myself for fucking up, I lost my way out and my future. 

That was in June.  I see all my friends starting school in the next week and I'm thinking how much of a failure I am to my parents.  My brother recently got his degree in business and my sister just left last week to get her degree. Everyday I feel like the biggest piece of shit in the world but I can hide it well.

And by that, I mean everybody.

In the past I ran away because of rejection that heavily impacted me. I know that we all go through this and it is part of life. But I dealt with it by disconnecting from all the people that were connected, its not the best method, but it allowed me to go up and down until 2 years ago.

I cannot run away... not this time. Her sister married my older brother and even on their wedding day we were the groomsman and bridesmaids. They're even having their first child soon, everything felt like... all the pain i felt in the past lead up to this defining turning point. It reassured what I truly felt 2 years ago, it wasn't lingering feelings or trying to find companionship or settling. It was beyond that.

She changed me... I felt more motivated in my life to change to become a better man for her... I was unsuccessful in finding a job in my career path, but i thought if i studied to become a real estate agent, I can work hard. Hopefully build up the courage to confess to her... one day. I started going to the gym and was frustrated at my inability to do the best I could at times. I wanted to change, I wanted to be a better person... Because of her.


Then I found out... she started seeing someone, someone from her work, and its very serious. He seems like a gentle and wonderful person. Calm, easy... but above all that... someone she loves.

Ever since I found out.. just the smallest things she tells me makes me break down heavily. My family has some hints but aren't sure exactly because I refuse to talk. I've started having insomnia, I ... I've even started hallucinating... peoples voices become white noise and I see her. I've become traumatised, I even stopped looking for a job because I know I won't be here soon. Its causing me to hope someone runs a red light and causes me to be in a car accident so the death looks accidental. For me to die from alcohol poisoning. I even asked for any 'god' to just kill me. 

At first she was going to move overseas, with him... I had the thought that when that happens I would drug myself and just die in my sleep from overdose.

She's excited with wanting to move in with him... she's even said he is her soul mate. I've even consoled her because she felt she betrayed him in some matters... even then I told her to stay with him... because she honestly loves him.

I love her... and I want her to be happy. 
I recently heard an analogy where suicide is like being in a burning building. I've wanted to jump for a long time... But i thought i'd run through the burning building... hoping I'll make it through. I thought I could try go through the rest of my life, knowing I will not be capable of these feelings with another, ever again.
I thought I could do it... But... I can't... 
If I could... I'd make everyone forget I ever existed... So I won't cause them pain when I die. I even prayed to god, i'm not religious or anything but I hope if they do exist... that they listened. so that I would take all the pain she suffered, and any sadness she may suffer for my life.   

I'm soon to become an uncle, and I don't think I will see my little niece or nephew grow up. I want her to be happy, I want her to grow more, be loved and to fulfill her dreams. To be married and have kids when shes 32 and grand children, to always have that beautiful smile, that infectious laugh, those deep eyes and the cheeks that red up when shes embarrassed. Soon I won't ever see her ever again.

Even now as I write this, I've broken down three times. I know I cannot go on. So I'm ready.

I've had money issues my entire life. I live in australia where we have reasonably decent welfare support. I have literally never been on welfare support before - growing up as a single child with a single mother, we were always on welfare and struggling to make ends meet. Now that I'm 21 and live with my partner, I am still on welfare, and still unemployed.

Sometimes I just can't handle it. I've been applying for jobs for years, in stints. I had no job during highschool so I have no retail experience, and while I'm in university I'm doing a degree in video game art and animation which is a terrible empty industry in australia.

I don't know why I get rejected from jobs. I have a great resume, I have good people skills. But I have a learning disorder based around math, Dyscalculia. It's equivalent to dyslexia but with numbers and equations instead. I can't do anything past basic addition and subtraction, I count on my fingers still, and I'm almost totally incapable of calculating bigger numbers. I'm abysmal at counting change. I'm basically incapable of working at a cash register because of this and I have absolutely no job confidence because of it.... I can't mention it in my resume because its obviously going to immediately put me in the rejection pile.

I love fish and animals and I have a couple of aquariums. A casual position in the aquarium department of my favourite pet store opened a couple of weeks ago and I applied immediately. It sounded amazing as I wouldn't be cashiering. After a week or so I.... actually got a call back and got an interview! I had the interview the other day and I thought it went pretty well; I wasn't nervous, I was confident, I answered the questions well enough and got on with the manager.

I got the call today saying I didn't get the job. I'm absolutely crushed. I don't know how to handle this, the only reason I'm not having an insane anxiety attack is because I recently stepped up to 20mg of my anti depressants and it's made me pretty numb to bad things happening. (or im not sure whether it's because im so used to feeling like im totally dead inside and in hell and *not* feeling like that because of medication is weird to me)

I'm so..... so tired of being unemployed. I'm so, so tired of trying so hard, for absolutely nothing. This was literally the first proper interview I have ever had. After years of trying on and off to get a job, my very first call. I don't understand what's wrong with me. I don't understand. I'm so tired of being poor, so tired of feeling like scummy trash because im unemployed, so tired of my girlfriend having to provide for me, im so tired of constantly having to borrow money from her because i cant afford basic things. im so tired of feeling like i have absolutely no future, that im going to end up like my mother who can only barely afford to feed herself. im just so tried of trying so hard for absolutely nothing and constantly having to feel like im absolutely worthless, of society telling me im absolutely worthless, of having absolutely no self worth. my body issues are starting to flair up again as well because of feeling worthless

this job would have changed everything. it was my dream job, at my favourite store, it would have given me financial security and i wouldnt have to be so scared of graduating from university into being.... unemployed and worthless again.

i just dont understand and if i wasnt on medication id want to give up right now. our new ultra insane and conservative government despises the unemployed as well and is slowly trying to systematically make the unemployed feel even more worthless and possibly homeless so yay",depression,t5_2qqqf,"chronic unemployment syndrome, didnt get my dream job position, tired of being worthless and depressed"

I just feel like a wild card and seem like one too. It's fucking hard for all the players in the game. So even I'm making it difficult to spread awareness and acceptance for BPD.

I get a little bit of a new beginning. I can't wait to sleep in my new room. I can't wait to make new memories there and watch my kiddo grow into a middle schooler and be able to have a friend over or go to the park or us even be able to do more things because I'll have a little bit of extra!

Just have to make it through September really.. Then.. things start to look up.

I've since seen my therapist a few times, and after going through my history, so much of it makes sense. All the mood changes, suicidal thoughts, delusions of grandeur, and a significant family history of mental illness (Everyone in the family has something). Turns out the SSRIs I've periodically been prescribed have been what triggered my hypomania. My therapist also expressed concern about the current medication I'm taking for ADHD (Adderall and Zoloft, definitely not a good mix for BP). She said to stay on the meds for now until my appointment with the psychiatrist next week. I'm going to have to come up with something to deal with the insomnia and racing thoughts in the meantime.

I was also told that I would eventually need to tell my parents about my diagnosis, my family is really accepting, but my mom gets *very* anxious *very* easily. I'm not sure how well she would take it. I suppose I could tell my dad, as he might have a more rational response. 

Should I confront them face-to-face about this, could I send them an email, or maybe tell them through my therapist?

The doctor there asked a lot of questions about my “support system” and recommended that I ask friends and family for emotional support. This is pretty reasonable advice because my biggest trigger is feeling isolated and lonely combined with panic over (maybe real, maybe imagined) fear of abandonment. 

However, I have no idea how to build a support system or talk to other people about it when I get urges (or ask for help afterwards like for a ride to the hospital—though it’s never gotten so bad that I couldn’t manage on my own). 

So here are my specific issues: I’m an adult who’s been self-harming on and off for over half my life. I don’t have the built in help that many teenagers and young adults have in the form of school counseling offices. I also feel like there’s less patience of sympathy for me than for younger people because at 29 I should’ve had this figured out by now. I have a lot of shame when it comes to talking to friends or family about it. It’s actually kind of terrifying.

I am covered in scars. None on my hands, neck or face, so I can hide them with clothing though.  Among my friends I maintain that I am “over it.” I do this so I don’t scare them away. I feel like I have to present as being extra-together to prove that my scars don’t define me and that I’m not crazy. 

I know that our often-repeated mantra when it comes to self-harm is “just talk to someone, “ but how do we do this without being the cutter who “just wants attention”? Seriously, I don’t understand how I can call someone up when I feel like cutting and tell them without it coming off as a manipulative demand; “pay attention to me or I’ll hurt myself.” To a lesser extent this also applies to telling people after the fact. 

From reading about how cutting affects family and friends, as well as talking to people I’ve come to understand that cutters are generally very emotionally taxing to the people who care about them. People often feel manipulated by a loved one’s self-injury or threats of it. Plenty of people will steer clear of relationships with cutters to avoid the drama. 

But there has to be some middle ground, right? 

I just wanna talk about specific strategies for asking for emotional support without burning out friends and family. How do you identify people in your social circle you can talk to? What do you say? How do you say it? Does anyone have any success stories with this?

Normally I would call what has been going on just mood swings as a result from puberty and all those weird hormones, but this has been going on for years and I find that the changes in her mood don't just come and go. Usually when she gets into a certain mood she seems stuck that way and it's hard for her to come down from it. Her moods change very abruptly and she gets very irritated, uncomfortable and upset over little things.

For example,today I met up with her on the bus. She was in a relatively good mood. I asked her how her day went and things like that, and she seemed to be doing fine. Well, up until she had to get up to let the person sitting next to her off. When she sat back down I could tell she was upset. I asked her what was wrong and she gave me a very aggressive ""nothing."" I asked her once more and she said, ""There's too many people on the bus."" Just having to get up to let someone pass is something that triggers her mood changes.

She also usually feels that people are coming for her when they're not. When I say that, I mean she takes every statement that's even a little stern and feels as if she's being targeted. This makes her deeply upset. When she tells me about what was said to her, she will often alter the situation so it seems like she was actually being verbally attacked.

The irritability and sudden changes in moods use to be much worse. When she was around 8-9, she would get extremely aggressive and violent. She'd throw things at me and hit me even when I was minding my own business, but especially when I'd ask her if she was okay. She'd talk casually about how she wanted to murder her sister and kill herself. It was really really disturbing. 

The only thing I can think of as to why she acts like this is bullying. Throughout most of her childhood she was bullied by multiple people. She'd get called fat and was told to go kill herself. Her mother also use to spank her as a form a discipline; but I don't know if that can cause issues in the long run.

I've tried speaking to her mother about it before but she didn't seem to think much about it. I'd like to bring it up again, but I feel like going up to her and saying ""hey, i think something is wrong with your daughter"" would be taken less seriously than stating exactly what I think is wrong with her and explaining how it matches up with how she's been acting.

I arrived at college on Wednesday (August 20th) hoping that it would be an awesome new chapter of my life. On the first day, I talked to a few people casually, and hit it off really well with this girl named...I'll call her Ellie. We went to all the orientation activities together and at the end of the night we said ""see ya"" and headed to our own separate dorms. I haven't seen her since. 

Yesterday, on the second day, I continued to talk to people who I was around and even made them laugh a lot. I still hadn't made any actual friends, but at least I could talk to people. I began to feel lonely, but I figured it's really early and I'll have all year to make friends.

 Now today, my third day, I have had almost no interaction with other people other than asking for directions or asking questions to an upper classmen in my major who was showing us the ropes. I still don't have anyone who I can say is a friend, or even close. I have no info about anyone I've talked to, so I can't hit them up and ask them if they want to hang out. Even my roommate has his own group of friends that he spends most of his time with, so I never see him. I couldn't find anyone to sit with at dinner, so I had to pull a mean girls and eat in the bathroom.

Tonight, the student entertainment group is hosting a cool party thing, with games, free stuff, and even a bouncy house. It sounded like fun, so I decided to go check it out. When I got there, everyone was in groups. Literally everyone. I was the only single person in the room. I just left, holding back tears. I got back to my room and I am now sitting alone in the dark, writing this, with tears rolling down my eyes, seconds away from resorting to self harm. The only reason I'm not is because I don't want to attract attention. I don't know what to do, or how to make friends. I've never been this lonely in my entire life. I don't know what to do. I'm so bored, sitting by myself, but I am too scared now to show my face in public.

tl;dr I just got to college a few days ago, and everyone is finding their friendship groups except me. I don't have a single friend.

Notes: I have clinical depression, but got it under control in the past few years. I have also always been very shy.

They also said that another big help would be getting some new friends. As if it was that easy for me to do or I wasn't even trying to do it. Eventually they started talking about football. The score of the game and how bad the team's quarterback is. Glad they really care.

Overall, they really don't seem to understand how depression is and think that I could do two ""little"" things to fix most of the problem and I couldn't say much because I was still so anxious.

So I've been in a psych ward for almost two weeks now, and last week a bunch of my friends decided to pop around to see me. First of all they didn't even ask if they can, they just announced that they will. Of course I was under no obligation to accept, and I could have said that I wish them not to come, as I felt ""iffy"" about it even before they even came. But I didn't, because I can't say no. And instead of my two best friends, both male, they brought their girlfriends too, both of which are my friends as well, but therein lied the problem. 

You see, I can't stand to see other people's happiness. I can't for the life of me join in on their joy, or be happy for them. I am a miserable, bitter, small man. It doesn't help that I was once too completely fallen for the other girl, but unlike my friend, I gave up six years ago. He didn't, and to the victor go the spoils so to say. Not that I treat or think of women as objects.
The whole half an hour they spent here were absolute agony. My hands were shaking the entire time, and in agony I tried to act like nothing was wrong. As did they, though it is laughably obvious that nothing is not wrong, or like things like they used to be. I just wanted them to leave, and never to come back. Afterwards I felt even more horrible, as I realized what a monumental dick I was for feeling that way. All my friends did was love and care about me, and I wanted them to stop. Not to mention the inability to be glad for them. And me being me, I didn't even tell the staff here how I felt, or sought any kind of aid to my shaken mental stability.

But I can't help myself. I can't be happy for anyone because I am so incredibly lonely all the time. What should I do? How can I cope with these feelings? Dare I tell those friends how I felt and feel still? I can't bear this anymore, thankfully I'm in this ward, I don't know what I might do otherwise.

I considered Suicide Watch and Introvert, but Depression seems like the best choice. This could be pretty long, so I apologize in advance.

To make a long story short, I've been suffering some pretty serious depression ever since I started college a couple of weeks ago. It's developed more and more each day and now I'm to the point where I want to kill myself. I've had issues with depression and suicidal thoughts in the past a couple of times and thought I had gotten over it all, but I was wrong. My brain is so fucked up that it traps me in my own prison. I hate myself, struggle to be happy and find joy in life, and don't think anyone could ever love me. I also have major issues with social anxiety, so I've made essentially no friends. Most days are spent locked inside my dorm feeling like shit. The list goes on an on. But there is a major trigger for all of this. A girl. We'll call her A.

A is a beautiful, amazing girl that I'm not afraid to admit I'm crazy about. From the moment I first met her, I fell in love. We're so alike in so many ways, and she's so funny and interesting and exciting. She was unlike any other girl I had ever met. She was real, and she was incredible. We hit it off almost immediately and talked for hours the first night. After that I was convinced that I had to have her. Then the depression and self hatred kicked in. I convinced myself that she was way to good for me, that I was worthless and ugly and that I didn't have a snowball's chance in hell with her. A thousand other negative thoughts popped up and before I knew it I was ready to jump off a building. I told my roommate, A's closest friend since high school, how I felt. He didn't seem too optimistic about it. The next day I spent alone in my room thinking of 1000 reasons why it would never work and told him to forget about it. It would never happen. But I haven't been able to stop thinking about her since. Even though she didn't do a damn thing to me, I've felt like dying since I met her all because I hate myself.

It's been nearly two weeks since we met. I've been seeing a counselor and feeling marginally better. Until last night. I heard my roommate talking to a guy in the hall about his girlfriend. This was news to me. I felt a sense of dread. Surely it isn't A, right? He would have told me! I asked him about it once we got back in the room. Casually, he told me. ""Oh yeah, I'm dating A now"". 

I lost my fucking mind. Logic and reason went out the window. It felt like he had taking a gun and shot me in the heart. I didn't know what to do or say. I ran to the bathroom to hide in a stall while screaming profanity. I hid in there for a while and came back to find my roommate gone. I starting taking things and throwing them, breaking stuff, and yelling. I slammed doors, yelled at my neighbors when they wouldn't shut up and generally wanted to tell the whole world to go fuck itself. Then I started to get mad at my roommate. Slowly I hated him more and more. He knew how crazy I was about her. He knew how much I liked her. And then he just does this. I wanted to kill him. Meanwhile I keep throwing and breaking things. Most of my possessions are on the floor. The rage and adrenaline went away after a couple of hours. Then I just felt cold and lifeless. I wanted to die. I hated myself, my roommate, A, the whole world. Roommate got back around 2 AM. I asked to talk to him about it, wanting to tell him everything. I could have easily ruined our friendship, but thankfully I restrained myself. He told me how long they'd known each other and that they had a history of dating. I just accepted it, knowing I'd been defeated. I went to my bed and wanted to cry. I couldn't shed a tear.

He left this morning to visit his parents for the weekend, so I've had the room to myself. The people on my floor think I'm an asshole now (probably) for yelling ""SHUT THE FUCK UP"" at the top of my lungs at 2 AM. I don't give a shit. I've spent the whole day in my room, cold and lifeless. I can get my mind off of it for a few hours with Netflix or video games or Reddit, but then my mind comes back to it all. I've wanted to kill myself more today than ever. I don't see my therapist until Thursday. I've felt jealousy more than rage now, and I'm completely obsessed with the thought that A and my roommate are going to be together happily ever after while I'm going to be... I don't know. Hopefully I'll die before I ever see them kiss or walk in on them having sex or something. 

I just feel so trapped right now. I know there's millions of other girls out there but A just feels like the perfect one, the only one. I know it's not true but it's all I can think about. ",depression,t5_2qqqf,This girl is driving me crazy.

I know no one will read it but I still want to vent out. I've been in a mental health place called Maria Sardiñas for about 3 years now. I regret the day I ever place foot into that place and knowing I can't do anything because of my mental illness. Being there feels like I am in a abusive relationship that has no way out. I am stuck with the worst people ever. I try so hard to go away from there but I need my medication inorder to be what people consider normal. The staff treat me like shit. Every time I make an appointment for either my so call therapist or psychiatrist the clinic cancels my appointment the exact day I'm suppose to go with out any reason. I actually go to the clinic not knowing this and when I do find out, its at the front desk and they tell me that I had cancelled an appointment and that they left a message and hour ago. Keep in mind I go on a bus, I have no cellphone, and it takes an hour t get to the clinic.When I tell them I didn't do that they say there's nothing they can do and if I want I can make an appointment again for NEXT month. This isn't the only thing they've done either. Once they made wait an hour outside the in the lobby and forgot to tell me that the group session they had for that day had been cancelled. Even after I kept asking every 15 minutes when the fuck the session was going to start. Another thing they do that when I do se my so call therapist she forgets why I am there. She never remembers what we worked on a week or two ago. She also doesn't understand what my needs are and tries to make her needs be met instead so she can get a good review for her notes and from her boss. One time when seeing the psychiatrist the nurse forgot to order my meds and I had to call for about a month to REMIND the nurse I need my medication. Well for a month I had no meds went through withdraws and then was told it was my fault for not calling or keeping in check with them. Lucky, because I'm so paranoid I had hid a bottle in my room a long time ago. Which helped with the withdraws a bit, but because the amount of medication was so little I ran out quick. And now I'm dealing with the same thing. It has been two weeks and everytime I call the nurse the receptionist tells me the nurse is either at lunch, was not there yet, had left, or is busy and she  ""will call you in a hour or so""... she never does call back. 
Ever since I was put in that place I have had my depression worsen. I don't tell them my emotions, or my thoughts anymore because they make me believe it is my fault. Idk if it is my fault, maybe it is and I deserve it. I've always been told everything that happens is my fault so maybe it is. Maybe they're making me see that everything I do is my fault and that because of it I deserve it. I used to go to another mental health clinic called Kickstart Program. They made me feel like I was human and made so many fond memories and friends. They made me believe I was someone and that I could be better one day. That getting my B.A degree did mean something, that volunteering, making speeches in front of a crowd of doctors helped people. That my story meant something. Maybe they were never really my friends and they were just using me. Since going to Maria Sardiñas... maybe it is my fault, I should give up, maybe Kickstart lied and I'm just nothing. Being mentally ill is bad and I should feel bad for it. I am nothing after all. Idk what to do anymore... I hate myself more than anything. I wish I could run away but no one is ever gonna give a job to a Schizo-affective and no one is going to want to be near me. Who would ever want to treat a freak like me.

The first few hours of the party went off without a hitch (although I did hit my head on the side of her pool), and then someone suggested spin-the-bottle.

Again, at first it was fine, but after awhile a female friend began actively trying to land the bottle on my SO (going so far as to stop the bottle with her hand), with the two of them proceeding to aggressively make out. It didn't help that my SO had been a little distant all night, and half the room would quietly respin if the bottle landed on me.

So I lost my temper and shouted at her about it. She started crying, and everyone else stood up and walked out.
I feel/felt absolutely terrible, and calmed her down, so she went to fetch them back, the result being that now everyone else is hanging out having a good time, and I'm sitting in a corner typing this post.

I don't know if I really have much of a point, and I'm sorry for all the rambling, but I really hate myself right now, and I can't stop thinking about how I'd rather be anywhere but here. I feel like harming myself, or just crying in a corner alone somewhere.

I quit smoking before, for 9 months and I was doing extremely well. I then hit a depressive low where I was feeling extremely suicidal and self harming, I didn't care about the dangers of smoking and just went back to it because, well, fuck it, thinking about suicide, what do I care about smoking cigarettes when I want to kill myself?

Got myself to the doctors, got everything sorted and here I am again quitting. But what happens if that frame of mind comes back? I was feeling pretty low yesterday, not at the same levels as last time, but honestly I don't know how I'll cope with quitting cigarettes if everytime I hit a massive low I just stop caring about my health and end up going back to the shop to buy a pack...

I'm a 17 year old male and I've been sad but not diagnosed with depression for a while now.  Throughout middle school, I always had plenty of friends and was seen as outgoing, but still had constant fears that I was disliked, which made me upset a lot.  Freshman and sophomore year of high school, I was extremely lonely and sad all the time.  I would spend most of my time just texting a couple of close friends of mine telling them how I want a girlfriend, (I bitched and moaned a lot). I was never quite seriously suicidal, and the fact that I'm usually sad never shows in social situations.  Junior year was amazing for me, I found a group of a bout 20 great friends, and found a girlfriend and she was the love of my life.  A couple of weeks ago, she broke up with me.  That is the real reason I am posting here.  We only had a 6 month relationship, (though we were with each other more than most married couples).  I could go on and on about who she was but really I'm just wondering if antidepressants would help right now?

I am not sure if I am really depressed because I have tons of friends and I seem happy in social situations.  I just have been contemplating suicide a lot lately and every night I end up crying or yelling to God to take me out of this world.  I haven't found pleasure in anything and have had trouble eating.

I had a job working with special ed kids. It was a decent job, but not like I was making a lot of money. I have a college degree so have been looking for other things at the same time. Last year, my boss said that I should look into being a special education teacher, so I got my paperwork set up and needed to find a job so I could 'earn while I learn'.

The college said that they would take 8% of my pay as their program cost, and that certain grants were available for areas that needed teachers. So I signed up.

I got a job teaching - yay. But I had to quit my old job to do it. The day after I quit, and the Friday before I start the teaching job, I get a call from the university - those grants that have existed for 20 years? Yea, they're gone now, so you are going to have to take out MORE student loans. I'm already 45K in debt from college round 1. Further, I filled out my FAFSA and am not eligible for anymore grants, because I used them during my first time in college. 

So here I am, I have a job that I will have to pay 8% of my salary, plus around 25K additional in loans and of course 2 years of courses and blood and sweat. And I just don't want to continue. I don't. 

So I called the suicide hotline. 

My folks freaked out and we went to urgent care and they sent us to a psych hospital and my mom is blaming herself and they all say that I am going to throw my life away. And I'm just having this massive sadness all the time.

I just don't know what to do, and I'm just so tired and want to sleep. I  feel lost. I'm sorry, I'm losing it now and the typing is getting hard.

**UPDATE**

I want to thank you all for your good thoughts and encouragement. I managed to get my old job back, which is great. I also looked more into the mental health benefits of my insurance and am going to see a psychiatrist soon. Also found out that my insurance covers 100% of inpatient mental therapy, so I might look around and see if there is a nice place nearby that I can go to and kind of work on things over a long weekend. 

I really want to thank the community for the support. Also, if you are feeling down, the people on the suicide hotline did help, at the very least in making me 'think' about what I was thinking of doing.

I'm 24 years old, and recently completed undergrad in the spring (Virginia). I was living in an apartment near my campus, and had to decide where I was going to go after the lease was up.

Ideally I wanted to move to Washington state. My partner lives there, and I love the area he's from. Unfortunately I was unable to find a place to stay in time, thus putting off my moving there for a minimum of another year. I do have a savings account with quite a bit saved, so it's not like I'm trying to move there with nothing to my name.

So with that choice being gone, it seemed my only option was to move in with my mother. My mother moved after I started college, and lives down in Texas. For some reason this option bothered me. I didn't want to move in with my mother, not because of her, but because I told myself I couldn't be happy in Texas. I was just completely turned off from living there, and plus my mom does live in an area with not much to do. I was convinced I wasn't going to be happy there, to the point I would cry about it.

One of my current apartmentmates said that we should live together. He's from outside D.C., so I'd still be in the state. I accepted his offer. I was still bummed that Washington fell through, but excited to hopefully get a fresh start in my post-college life.

Apartment hunting began, and fear struck with wondering if we could afford something. Eventually my friend called me and asked how I would feel about living with his parents.
Honestly I wasn't 100% on board with the idea. I got used to having a place where I could do what I wanted. Walk to the kitchen in my underwear or get drunk in the living area.
But I'm very anxiety ridden around people I don't know. Especially people's parents. But I didn't want to be ""that person"". I didn't want to say, ""No I don't want to live with your parents"", when that was an option that could make his life easier.

His parents found a house to rent, and they get approved for the lease. We moved in August 1st. The first thing that made me uncomfortable was when I learned that the owners of the house aren't supposed to know I'm technically living there. If they found out, I would have to say I'm my friend's girlfriend.
So my friend and his parents are intense with each other. Usually his mom or dad talk to him, he gets frustrated and raises his voice and curses, they criticize each other, etc. Their family dynamic makes me uncomfortable, and I usually try and hide from it whenever possible.

And I feel out of place, since I am in a house with a family of 4 (4th being his brother), and then there is me. I'm nervous and anxious around his parents, and don't really know how to make conversation with them. I get nervous to go in any part of the house that is not my room or my friend's.

Here's the whammy too, I don't have my license. I desperately want it, but my current living situation makes it very hard for me to do so. It's extremely frustrating, and it means I don't get out much besides work. For work my friend takes me. On occasion his parents have dropped me off. It's embarrassing and I wish I could take myself where I needed to go.

My mother has told me several times that if things get too much, I can simply move in.
Now I'm beginning to wonder, what if I did?

She's already said I wouldn't have to worry about rent or groceries. She would drive me where I needed to go and we could work on my license. We could try and work on my health situation.
(I have clinical depression and no health insurance, so I have not been on medication or going to therapy for a while, though I obviously need to).

The only thing she said I would be paying would be my student loans.
The idea entices me because I could be saving up more money to move to Washington. I could also do things like buy myself nice clothes and work on myself.
(Paying around 790 a month as opposed to just 155).

And I do miss my mom. I haven't seen her a whole lot because of college. When we talk on the phone I feel like it's not enough.

I'm still nervous about the idea of moving in with her though. Because of my social anxiety and lack of driving skills, I have extreme trouble making friends. The only friend I talk to on a regular basis is the one I'm living with. I know if I move in with her, I'll have no one to hang out with with similar interests, and I'll be lonely.
Though I think about things like how I'm too nervous to go in the kitchen and fry an egg and ask myself am I doing what's best for me.

Though here's another whammy, I am not sure his family could afford the house without my share. See his parents are very tight on money, and have been living in an apartment the past few years. Being able to live in a house again is a big thing for them, and I'm not sure if they would even have decided on renting this house if I wasn't in the picture.

They know I plan on taking off after a year, in which gives them time to perhaps save money or find other options. But if I said, ""I'm moving in with my mother, here's my 30 days"", I'm not sure what they'd do. Not to mention my fear of them hating me, as well as my friend.
When I mentioned what my mother said about moving in with her, he said, ""Well that's something you can possibly do in a year.""

As if, moving out now isn't an option. I'm scared to even mention the fact I'm thinking about it.
I'm not even exactly sure where I would be happier. What would be the best for me. My depression weighs on me, and I know if I was living with my mom she could help me with it. But if I stay here I could perhaps get something out of it.

I suppose the reason I'm indecisive is because I make decisions and regret them, or second guess. Such as going to college in Virginia and not going with my mom (regret), and now remaining here and not moving in with my mom (second guessing). It's only a year as opposed to 5 years of college, but it's still time I don't want to spend unhappy...",depression,t5_2qqqf,Is moving back in my mom best for me and working on my depression?

I'd alternate between mental breakdowns and being literally unable to push myself out of bed. My grades dropped drastically and I didn't even care. I'd just find myself staring at walls as well as not eating. I'd come straight home from school and sleep until the next day, or I wouldn't even sleep at all. I had missed almost 40 days of school when the limit was 12.

So my mom agreed to take me out of school and be home schooled. For the rest of that year I felt so much relief. I still had an occasional episode but things were overall very much better. I think the thing I enjoyed the most was not being in a room full of people and not being pushed to turn in work the next day, especially since my motivation was always lacking. I did so much better working in a quiet environment cut off from everyone else than I ever did throughout any school year.

But my family didn't really understand no matter how much they tried. Every time I saw them they'd bug me about going back to ""actual"" school. My mom would always say things like, ""don't you miss your friends?"" or ""please go back, i loved high school."" I knew she was just trying to comfort me or whatever, but she had never been in my situation so the words were just empty. She was pretty and popular. I lost most of my friends and was never engaged. No one cared who I was.

But for some reason I gave in. Maybe I was tired of the constant requests to go back. My mom registered me back and here I am, a week into school.

I know what's eventually going to happen, though. I've had three breakdowns since school started for no specific reason. It's like once I get home it all just hits me. My insomnia is worse. It's been taking me up to two hours to sleep. So now I'm just trying to trail my mind away from this and stay motivated. I know after so many breakdowns I'm just going to lose everything and feel completely dead.

What I do is, if I'm feeling sleepy or anxious I take out a notebook and list all of the things I'll be able to do if I push through the day. Relax, watch my shows, drink soda, nap, etc. I also have a little whiteboard where I countdown how many days of school are left. Each day I make it home, I erase the number and make it one less. It's really rewarding for some reason.

But unfortunately I feel like this isn't going to last as long as I want it to. I get bored pretty quickly :\ What are some things you did to make it through a school day, or school year? The problem I have is if things get bad for me again I can't take myself back out of school, so I need some new things to keep me motivated. Any suggestions?",depression,t5_2qqqf,Making it through school with depression.

So I go to class and don't speak to anyone (I don't really understand why I'm afraid to) and I go home. I meet people when I get dragged to events but I can't make real friends. I try to reach out but I either get no response or they're busy. I just want someone that I can speak to daily, and have a little deeper of a conversation with. I always had people depending on me but I've never had anyone to depend on for myself. Even if I finally connect with someone, after a week or so they're gone.

I had a long four day weekend of staying in my bed doing nothing and hoping I would just die. It's only the third week of school and I missed two days already.
My favorite teacher (who is no longer my teacher but I visit her everyday) texted me asking where I was. I told her I just stayed home. Then on Monday she asked where I had been and if I was doing ok and that she was worried. I didn't get the text til the next day where I had to go to school because I had no excuses to tell my mom. 
When I went to school I of course visited my teacher who, again, asked where I was. I just told her I didn't feel like going to school. Then, at the end of that day I went to say goodbye to her like I usually do. She got up from her desk and asked ""you doing okay?"" And I told her I was just tired. She gave me a hug and I left.
Then, the next day when I went to visit her she asked me what I did during my extremely long weekend. Which I said ""nothing"" except read a book. She asked me ""how is life?"" And I just nodded my head and said good. Then she asked again ""how's your anxiety been lately?""
She's the only person I ever told in my school or of my friends that I have anxiety. She responded ""it just is weird to me that you missed two days of school- in a row. Last year you missed like two days of school all last year. Two days in a row- the beginning of the school year?""
I didn't really know what to say. She's the only person who gives me hugs and asks if I'm ok.

She said if I ever thought of it to tell her. But I'm scared. I trust her more than anyone but I am scared of my parents finding out. I'm not close to them and I don't want them to find out.

There are good days and there are bad days that I experience with my family and with myself. I am at a point where I can properly analyze myself, but honestly, I scare myself and now my thoughts are concerning me.
 
**Some background**: I grew up with an emotionally and mentally abusive mother and a father who emotionally and physically neglects me. I have 6 siblings (4 different fathers) now and I have a really disconnected relationship with all of them because its incredibly overwhelming for me to be with them. I have also faced a lot of financial situations with my family, we struggle a lot. My family is also highly religious and passionate for the Jehovah Witness religion and are against medication, where I do not share their passion, so its problematic. 

In the past my mother my mother left me a lot and that put me in a position to always watch and nurture the kids, so a lot of the time I feel like I was raising my siblings and not her. It was hard raising my older brother (he is autistic) and my younger siblings.I am one of the middle children and then my younger is the second middle child, she has has ADHD (not medicated) and my younger brother has anger problems. The 6th child was born and is currently 2 months old, I'm also expected to put a lot of effort to take care of this child. My eldest brother also suffers from anger issues and has been highly influenced to not respect woman.

When I was a child I faced a time where my Eldest brother forced me to do sexual acts to him or else he would threaten to hurt me and make my life hell. There was been times where he was unable to control his anger and has choked me and has once given me a bloody nose. Eventually the sexual acts stopped and he got bored of me and moved on. I never told my family about this because no one would believe me and my eldest brother is more respected in the family then I am. 

Another thing that ruined my childhood was when I was 10 my grandfather molested me for 2 years and said if I told anyone he would do what he does to me to my sister. I never want anyone to hurt my sister, so I protected her by putting myself forward always watching over her when we were around my grandfather. My grandfather grew up with morals of ""Woman are nothing but objects"" he also taught my eldest brother that attitude as well.During that time period I faced a large amounts of events where I was continuously molested by my grandfather.  One day I had enough of my grandfathers sexual harassment and told a trusted teacher and she called child's aid and my entire family was informed. Where I thought I would receive support from my family, but instead I received the complete opposite and all the blame was put on me, as well as a lot of family shame weighed on my shoulders. I later found out that my families opinion of the situation and lack of support was formed by my grandfather who apparently has a lot of power over the family. At my uncles wedding my family came up to me one by one privately telling me the most discouraging and most sickening things that no child should hear from their family. It consisted of them telling me how much of a liar I was and how disgusting I am for telling people of these lies, basically I broke up the entire family because of speaking out about someone hurting me. From there I grew up with little support from my family, even my parents deny what has happened don't consider me as a daughter. 

Dealing with my family and these two events growing up I battled with a lot of thoughts of self harm, and the odd time suicide. I've attempted cutting at one point after an argument escalated with my mother and she  told me to do it and to kill myself, while attempting I consciously thought how disgusting it is and stopped and have never done it again. The thought of cutting or any form of self harm makes me cringe and it makes me feel so sad that people use this method as a temporary solution. The thoughts of suicide is just a mental phase that happens from time to time, but never have I had the desire to actually do it. So there is a lot of credit that I give to myself. 

5 months ago I got out of a long term romantic relationship that I was committed to for 2 years. It was a relationship that I highly valued and had clear and healthy intentions, never was I unfaithful, but unfortunately experienced a lot of times where my partner was unfaithful behind my back and constantly used me for sexual purposes. So, if I didnt sexually please him, he would go elsewhere to find someone else to fool around with, of course I didn't find this out until the last few months of my relationship. I took the initiative to end it and have been going through a cleansing period, meaning a time where I can mentally and emotionally focus on myself and bettering myself. I want to prepare myself for the next relationship, but experiencing my last relationship I was able to discover what I am looking for in a person, as well as what I am like in a relationship. So I definitely learned a lot. 

**Currently**: I consider myself as an individual who is battling with self identity and can't quite grab the concept of what makes me happy. A lot of the time i'm always searching for others to help them be happy and cope with themselves, but I find it hard to provide myself my own answers and to help myself. My relationship with my friends is shaky because I get to experience something that isn't hostile. But a lot of the time I find myself becoming incredibly overwhelmed by socializing and i'm not sure why. My therapist brought up to ma a solid point. She said that I find it uncomfortable to be happy, so opportunities of people helping me, it makes me uncomfortable and therefore conflicting with family morals and my own morals. 


To this day I constantly fight with my mother about what I should do with my life and frankly, I feel quite lost. I'm at the next step in my life where I need to find out what kind of career I want to for the rest of my life. I've considered:

1.CYW - Child and Youth Worker
2. Therapist/Counseling  
3. Something that involves helping others

**Overall** I really don't know what I am battling, I don't think I am depressed because I can be incredibly optimistic and really happy a lot of the time, but when im with my family is when I absorb the toxic atmosphere and deal with my own toxic thoughts. Perhaps i'm dealing with a great amounts of stress? I as well want to move out and move on but I don't have a plan and I am incredibly fearful of the future. 

Sorry if this post was long but any form of advice would be much appreciated. I even thank you for taking the time to read this, it makes me incredibly happy.  ",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,I don't know how to help myself.

I've been diagnosed with depression multiple times in my adult life. The most recent was in 2010 or '11 when I was diagnosed with ""Major Depressive Disorder."" I have tried various medical treatments before ultimately calling bullshit and refusing to take pills that no doctor is able to assure me will help.

I had a realization recently that I'm not happy. I did an ""inventory"" and looked at the things I've tried to make me happy since my diagnosis. Women, men, drugs (prescription and otherwise), family life and kids, hobbies, support groups, talk therapy...basically, you name it, I've tried it. The problem is, nothing ever helps. Nothing ever works and no matter how much I think I have it beat, or have it in check nothing helps. I'm starting to feel hopeless. I'm starting to feel like I just can't be a happy person. That nothing is ever fulfilling or enough for me. When I'm given exactly what it is I think I'm missing, it somehow isn't enough and I feel like its all wrong. I've had a marriage and several subsequent relationships fall prey as lover after lover discovers they can't ""handle"" a partner with clinical depression. I can't go back to the meds because 1.) they never work. 2.) I can't afford it because my insurance policy sucks and I don't have the money to even explore medical treatment properly. 3.) I don't want them. The side effects (loss of sex drive, impotence, feeling numb, like a zombie) make the depression worse. 

I'm scared to death. Its almost like I can feel my relationship disentegrating around me, as if everything I love is looking at me in pity and disgust as it goes on to do what it needs to do to have a happy existence. I can't say I'm suicidal (I don't really view it as a valid option) but I can't see any other way out of this neverending cycle. I know I won't feel this way forever, because I never do...its just that I really can't take the cycle repeating over and over. I can't sit back and watch what I'm doing to my family, friends and loved ones. Pushing them away seems like a mercy at times but still, it hurts them as much as me.

I used to be afraid I'd go to hell. I was afraid of suffering. But I don't think my suffering matters anymore, at least not as much as I thought it did. I am one of many creatures who can experience pain. When you look at the big picture, the suffering of one doesn't mean much.

I used to enjoy suffering. It was punishment. Penance. Because I thought I was inherently worthless because I ignored all the people who were telling me otherwise. I'm no more or less worthless than anyone else. I'm in control of my destiny, I've just been unconscious at the helm.

Unfortunately this epiphany has come about six years too late and now I have to rebuild everything. I no longer have a social structure I can build from because in my selfish existential doubt I let most of my bridges rot away.

But I think I can start rebuilding. I just have to do one thing.

I have to believe I have worth, and I have to believe life is worth living. In order to do that, I think I need to face death. I need to put myself in a position where I have to choose life or death. I have to convince myself, not out of instinct or will to survive, that not jumping is the better option. I can't let fears of or for others influence me, it has to come from within. Otherwise I'm not really living, I'm just surviving.

I don't know how long this clarity is going to last. I can already feel it slipping away. But I'll be able to look back at this and remember, hopefully. Lately my memory hasn't been that great, and my emotions are becoming more and more unstable. I'm hopeful one second and despondent the next. I just hope that some part of the freedom I felt in the last half hour of writing this post sticks around. I wasn't afraid of failing my classes. I wasn't afraid other people would hate me. I wasn't afraid of death.

Anyway, I think what I was trying to convey in this post is that I know I can't define my identity with one aspect of myself. I used to be obsessed with intellect. I had to be the smartest. It was all I had. It's still all I have. I'm not athletic. I'm not good with people. I don't have am extraordinary work ethic. I'm good at remembering things.

But at least now I know I need to find something else. I just don't know what it could be. Or maybe I need to stop worrying about identity and just *be*. Just be content with what I am, with who I am. Or at the very least who I could be.

I'm going to be late, but I think I might be able to start figuring out who I am now. What I am.",depression,t5_2qqqf,"I'm not afraid anymore, and I think I've figured out what I have to do."

I can never talk to them because they always tell me to get over something. My favorite teacher isn't my teacher anymore and I miss her a lot. I visit her every morning before class starts but it's not the same. Her class was the one thing I looked forward to but now I don't even have that. I miss her. I'm closer to her than my own family. 
My parents will be gone for a week starting Sunday. I'll be the only one home. I have access to pills, guns, knives, anything. No one can stop me and I'm scared. I'm scared I'll come home from school one day and just end it. I hate everything, I don't exactly want to die, I just don't want to feel this way anymore. I feel like that's the only way though.

I went to a therapist maybe twice and to a doctor once. I stopped taking my medicine awhile ago because it only worsened things and made me extremely shakey 24/7 even sometimes while I slept... I ... I'm so fucking tired. I'm so fucking lonely. I just wanna go to sleep and never wake up. I don't have anyone to talk to but one person. My girlfriend, but she's so busy and never understands. I've been growing more and more distant from her despite knowing she makes me happy through it all. It's like I no longer want to be happy... I never get to see her but maybe once every two-three weeks? That once every two- three weeks that I have a social interaction. I know someone may say ""go out and make friends!"" There is no place to go out and I do not know how to make friends. Every friend I made in the past was through a previous friends. Now my past friends are widely spread out in college or no longer in touch. I'm nineteen turning twenty in December, starting college in January. Not looking forward to college though cause I will just be lonely among people. I... I want to cry so bad but my tears just won't come out when I want to cry the most. They come out when I least suspect it... What do I do? I wish I could just close my eyes and wake up from a bad dream. I wish I would wake up and I would be among someone... Just one. You know, I don't even want a lot of friends. Just one. All I want is one. I don't mean over the internet either. I've tried and tried again with trying to just settle for only internet friends. I had that for most of my life. I wish sometimes I never had gotten the friends I once did have. Maybe life would be different. How do I cry out for someone? I don't know... I don't want them to get upset or just tell me the usual ""Just be happy. Why can't you be happy?"" I can't take that... Not anymore. I'm so tired... I've never posted here before... I don't even know what I'm expecting... I... I don't want to be here anymore. Yet, I don't want to kill myself. I haven't wanted to kill myself in months. Not truly anyway. I just... I just... I'm just so tired. Tired of being lonely. Tired of this overbearing loneliness and this pain in my chest I wake up with everyday. I'm tired of feeling as if maybe I just don't belong on this world. Maybe this world wasn't meant for me. I mean I am black. Yet I sound and talk ""white"". So I don't really get accepted by any social groups. It's funny really. Only time I sound ""black"" is when I'm extremely pissed and want to defend a loved one(only have one of those). Otherwise I sound like a ""country white kid"". I get made fun of by blacks and whites. It's really fun. Just getting told I'm ""the happy nigger"".... It's not fun.. It's not funny. It's really depressing and I'm so tired of it all. I wanna yell ""someone please kill me"" cause I can't do it myself... I've even thought about suicide by cop. I mean surely some Georgia cop would love to kill a black kid with a fake water gun painted black right? ... Well? ... I can't muster the courage to do that either. I'm so scared to die... Yet I'm so tired of living... I'm so lonely and I'm so sad. There so much more to this... But this is all I can muster out... I... I'm so lonely. 


UPDATE 1: I posted this to suicide watch as well due to escalating emotions..

UPDATE 2: I figured I would give more background about myself. I was born in Atlanta in a rougher part of town. My dad and mom split so I didn't really see my dad but once a year and sometimes not that at least until my sophomore year in high school where it was nearly monthly. My grandparents raised me the most since my mom was at work most of the time and became a bit abusive the older I got. In elementary school I had one friend in kindergarten but then he moved. At home, I was satisfied despite thinking of suicide even at that young age. My dog is what kept my going at that time. His name was TJ and he was my best friend. He however, died which sent me spiraling down a deeper depression especially since that dog had been there since my birth and even scared away some bullies in 1st grade when some boys were bullying me. He never came out the fence but that day, he came out the fence and was growling. But in my fourth grade year he died. Come seventh grade, I was raped for the first time by a girl. (I feel that much more pathetic for it being a girl though I had been molested in my earlier years by a boy). She would come again and do it two more times and even act friendly afterwards. Late in my seventh grade year, the only person who ever truly said they were proud of me and listened to anything I had to say, the person I trusted the most, starting getting extremely sick. My grandfather. By 9th grade he was wheelchair bound, strong but wheelchair bound. I had to transfer schools (In middle school I moved out to the country side. When I transferred, I was back in Atlanta) I went to Mays High School. It was horrible. The gangs, how loud people were and just... It was horrible. I was really miserable and I went from being chubby to extremely skinny. My ribs were even showing. I didn't eat but once a day if even that and I drinked heavily. I didn't smoke though but at times I consider picking it up to try and relieve something... My grandpa died my junior year during spring break. It killed me. I attempted suicide twice that summer and failed. Senior year, I met my girlfriend. We had our ups an downs but we always have made it through. She saw my forcing a smile and (from what her friends and family tell me) she fell in love with my smile and pursued me. Within a week I honestly fell in love. I was timid to it but I fell in love. Yet... Now I push away from her though she saved me after my grandpa's death. She didn't know it at the time, but meeting her was the best thing to ever happen to me. But now... She's finishing school and wants to live with me about a year from now or at the latest a year and a half... I however... I don't even want to make it through next week. I feel so lonely and pathetic. I feel so selfish now that I think about it but... I... I can't explain everything going on through my mind. I' just want to never wake up again.",depression,t5_2qqqf,I'm lonely...

I know we don't gel well together but I'm too egoistic and lonely to just let go. And whenever I do let go, I become disinterested in everything. I lose whatever passion I have left for most of my activities. When I'm 'chasing' her, I try to be my best. 

I feel I want to be needed. I wish she would care. She did, but I feel I messed it up.

And I keep trying to fix it and make it alright. I will again, I know, I look for hope.

Truth is, she's alright without me. She is much less needy than I am, she's okay without talking, she's okay if she ignores me in class. It's all okay for her. She's peaceful. She'll be okay not talking to me.

She did tell me she liked things about me, but I suppose she backed off because of how sensitive I was, how easily bothered I was with little things. 

Apparently people who don't pay as much attention are just fine. They're okay. They don't connect the dots and reason out and get bothered so much. 

I feel very alone since my schizophrenic mother left me. It was around 7 years back, when I was 13.
She was so nice. She always knew. She brought me random happiness. I hardly connect to my father.

Hell, I don't even know what I want, what would make me okay, if not happy. I don't know if I'd be satisfied with the love I get, or the life I might make for myself, or the spiritual peace I try to acquire. 
Come to look at it, there's no reason to believe things are going to be better. Things just are this way.

The reason I never speak in class discussions or at all isn't because I have nothing to contribute. I sit there and listen to everybody spouting the first random thought that pops into their heads and just think. It isn't ignorance that holds my tongue, but fear. I have great ideas and opinions but I never share them. I don't know if I'm more afraid of what people will think of them or if I'm just afraid of being heard, of having attention, of being anything more than just a body in a chair.

I've been struggling with SA and depression for a while now, although I didn't really realize it until last year. I always thought ""No, I'm stronger than that. I would be able to just think my way out of it. I don't have depression, I would totally be able to kick it's ass!"" But as it turns out, I have been suffering since at least 6th grade, and I'm a junior in college now. 6th grade is the first time I can specifically remember it affecting me. I was laying in bed awake and crying for no reason other than ""life"" and the thought of suicide popped in my head. I've never considered committing suicide, but I think about it a lot. About how I could do it, about how it would effect the people I know, if I would leave a note and what I would write. But I've never actually thought to myself ""I should commit suicide.""

I started counseling the last few weeks of school last year. (I can get it free through the school) and didn't really get too far. When I got home I thought ""I should find a therapist in the area and continue."" but it never happened. By the time I had built up the courage to actually pursue it there were only 2 weeks left of summer break. Now it's the second week of the school year and I can already feel myself slinking away from everyone and everything even more than I have in the past.

I'll probably never speak effortlessly like a normal person. Till now I always made an effort to go out and be with friends, but it's always been hard for me to feel restricted in person. I'll never have the level of connection I want with the people I care so dearly for. I love talking online because I don't struggle with my speech online, I can just be at ease. But that has gotten too lonely to bear.

I love piano and computer games, but after discovering how weak and uncoordinated my right hand is, I've given up on my only two hobbies. I know I'll never be good enough, even with all the practice in the world. I know I could've been so much better.

I am more passionate about music than anything else in my life, but I have progressive hearing loss in both ears. Music has slowly lost more and more of it's quality to me. I still try my best to enjoy what's left because I could never give it up, but every time i hear a song I love, I feel like dying inside. And the world sounds like I'm in a bubble, I feel disconnected from the world around me. It doesn't sound alive anymore, it just sounds dead and depressing.

I feel like I have nothing left to live for. I'm supposed to start uni abroad in 8 days, but I can't even bring myself to leave my house, let alone fly overseas and start a 4 year course. I've spent the last 5 weeks doing nothing but lie in bed, eat, and talk to friends online. Going out with friends or alone just makes me feel worse.

The only thing that gives me relief is fantasizing constantly about killing myself and ending my suffering, but I know I'll be too scared to do it when the moment comes. And it won't bring me the happiness of a normal life that I so dearly want, I'll just cease to exist.

My friends and family try their best to talk to me but they can't help at all. In desperation they suggested that a trained professional might be able to console me, cause it's their job to ease the pain of depressed clients right? I went to 7-8 psychiatrists and psychologists, and all of them were useless. I walked out of their offices every time feeling even worse that I made my parents pay thousands to get no help in return.


I'm slightly different from many people on this sub I suppose.. I'm not clinically depressed, but I am sad and depressed beyond words at my situation. I did some depression tests for god knows what reason, and my scores on all of them were through the roof. I've been on and off antidepressants, but they don't help cause I just hate my life. I don't think you can even call what i have a life.

I'm surrounded by friends and family who care deeply, but none of them can do a damn thing. They've already stopped trying to help cause whatever they do just makes me feel the same or worse. We've talked for hours, till everything that can be said already has been. They can't say anything new. I just hope one day I'll be able to summon the will, the courage to just say ""fuck this miserable life"" and end it in an instant.


I'm not sure what you guys can say or do, but I've exhausted all other options. Please help my poor soul T_T",depression,t5_2qqqf,"Depressed/sad, I don't know. I just hate my ""life""."

I always just thought I was kind of quiet and a little cynical. But last year I realized it went way beyond that. I found myself getting incredibly anxious over the most trivial of things like passing a friend in the hall, or standing next to someone at the cross walk. I also found myself losing any interest I had left in everything and my days devolved into just existing. I finally started questioning why I always felt scared and sad and after really thinking about it I realized that I've been struggling with these feelings since at least 6th grade. I think it started sometime around there and has slowly progressed to where it is today. All through high school I had a great relationship but that ended after freshman year in college. I think after we broke up I really started noticing all these feelings. Like they had always been there, but the relationship ending was the catalyst that really sent it into overdrive. 

Lately I've been literally just existing. I've lost all interest in everything I used to find fun. I almost never leave my room except for class. I hardly ever respond to texts or emails from my professors and friends. I do the bare minimum of work to get by. Even on my best days I still feel awful.

At first, it's going very bad in school. This is just the second week on my new study, but almost everything already went wrong. I didn't go to the introduction (two days that were the week before school began) because I didn't know there even was one. I called them when I found out (the day after the introduction) and they told me it wasn't required to go to it and I hadn't missed that much. That was a big fucking lie. Apparently there was a lesson Japanese (I study that) in which my classmates already got homework and a homework planning and the news that a lot of lessons wouldn't be there the first two weeks. Well, I never heard anything of that. I was there Monday and waited 3 hours in school, to have NO LESSON AT ALL. And the second day? Everybody already knew all the hiragana while I hadn't even began learning it because I didn't know! I still have a backlog, even though that was a week ago. And you know what? This weekend we had to learn katakana, but again, I didn't know so I have this HUGE FUCKING BACKLOG that will take HOURS and HOURS of studying while I have tons of other homework too!  It's so damn much, I can't fucking do this! I'm not a learning-robot that can learn a whole writing in two days! I'm on the edge of collapsing under stress because it's too damn much. I'm tired all the time because I have so much to do I can barely rest and even almost fell asleep in school a few times.

What doesn't makes it easier is that it's going downwards with my mental health lately. I had a good conversation about it with my boyfriend yesterday, and he sincerely thinks a mental hospital would be the best option for me right now. He says that I've chanced.

In these fantasies I am never alone. There is someone there that I can emotionally destroy by my (usually) violent passing.

This is a common thing for me. I love the idea of shooting myself in the head in front of people getting morning coffee. I like the idea of jumping off a building into a crowded area. These are the situations I fantasize about.

A while back my cousin rolled her eyes at me in the car after I asked her to repeat something she said. I desperately wanted to be part of the conversation (hadn't spoken to anyone in a while, had been very depressed). The next thing I know, all I want is to walk into the living room while she's watching tv and point a loaded shotgun at my head.

These are things I deal with constantly.

Right now I am using words like ""want"" and ""fantasy."" I want to make it clear that I am close to killing myself constantly. I don't think these with a smile on my face. There have been at least 3 occasions where I stared at nothing, asking if I want to die until I saw nothing.

The answer is always yes.

That is the part I leave out when telling my friends/family. The answer is always yes. I want to die, but I don't want to hurt them. If I was not loved, I would be dead.

But I resent them for it. I want them to let me die. I see no future for myself, no relief of any kind.

I have anxiety that prevents any normal employment. I've had many jobs. Most I have quit because my anxiety got so high I couldn't do tasks I would normally be able to do. That or I look ahead and see nothing but putting things into boxes and choose death.

You may be looking at this and thinking ""Well that really doesn't sound like something to be suicidal over."" Although I disagree with you, I also have something else I can't get away from.

My anxiety also prevents me from forming any romantic relationship. Early in my formative years I was called creepy by multiple girls. For those of you who throw that word out like it's fucking nothing, let me tell you something. To say to someone that your shows of affection make you uncomfortable or even scare you, hurts. It hurts bad. I was never the same. I don't want to hurt people or make people scarred. So I just stopped.

I am social, I am not bad-looking and have been pursued many times by girls/women who I perceived as attractive. But the anxiety tells me to pull away, everything in my body tells me to pull away.

So I gave up. I pushed the thought that I'm missing out on a huge part of life away. That it would be best to not force those situations on myself. Best to just let it happen. And I am not a recluse, I jump at the chance to go out with friends, even to go to places where there are many ladies. I talk to them, but I don't play the fucking game.

And by that I mean any of it. If I like you I will tell you, and you can be sure I mean it. I do not look for sex even though I have not experienced anything close. I have never felt love like all of my friends.

I cannot keep a job. Which kills me every time. When I leave another place the same thought process happens. When will this end? Am I going to become homeless? It spirals down until all I want to do is bring people out of their happy little lives and show them that people are suffering right next to them, in the most violent way possible. I want people to think of that time when the guy shot himself in front of the club at peak hours, or when some dude fell to his death in the road during rush hour.

I have had no change during my time taking (prescribed) drugs, therapy, both and neither. 

The only future for myself I see, is work at some job until I can't take it anymore, then die. Because even if I could not work, the guilt would be enough to kill me anyway.

If you read this whole thing know that this is not a joke, I deal with this constantly. To me it's not a question of IF anymore. It's just when.",depression,t5_2qqqf,Suicide as the Ultimate Revenge

1. i often wake up in the morning for work and feel that it's utterly impossible to get out of bed. this is made worse because every night i have happy dreams of my ex and i just want to go back to sleep where i'll feel happy again. so i call in sick very often, maybe once every two weeks. my employers are lenient and i have a chronic illness that makes a convenient excuse, but i feel like an evil shithead for doing this over and over.

2. i have intense difficulty making phone calls, but mostly to companies not to individual people. for example, calling my insurance company to try and resolve some screw ups they've made seems so impossible that i just haven't done it, despite knowing that soon enough the debts they screwed up on paying will go to a debt collector and my credit will be fucked.

3. when people ask how i'm doing i cannot EVER seem to tell them the genuine depth of my depression. even to my therapist for god's sake. when i start saying it out loud it seems like whining. or i start rationalizing that things are not as bad as they seem, and ""maybe if i put a positive spin on it out loud, it'll help me feel better for real!"" but that never actually happens.

4. this one is maybe the most agonizing of all lately. i CAN'T STOP having fantasies of running into my ex or having conversations with him, and these fantasies are almost always angry and hateful and leave me feeling terrible. like i imagine bumping into him in real life and telling him that if he doesn't get away from me i'll physically hurt him. or i imagine texting him and telling him exactly the things i know will emotionally hurt him the most. seriously, it's been EIGHT MONTHS, but for hours of every day i'm living out this fantasy life in my head like i'm still talking to him in real life...and it's not even happy conversations. i hate it so much.

     I've struggled with suicidal urges and depression since I was around 12. My mom is a wonderful person and I love her, but every time I did something wrong and she'd yell at me, I'd have a flash of suicidal urges; just fantasizing about making here regret yelling at me for not doing the dishes or something. It wasn't really serious until I put a gun to my head when I was 16. My mom had just yelled at me for watching a TV show while doing my work (I'm home schooled) and I just walked into their room and pulled out the gun that they keep in case of danger. I put it to my head, realized that that wasn't the best of moves, went down stairs, and unloaded thoughts that had been pent up for five years. I still seriously struggle, and, at times, it's gotten worse. I've realized that I'm a monster of human being who tells people the horror stories of depression, suicide, and cutting myself because I feel empty and alone without my friends. I've been rejected by girls and the one woman I've loved has grown away from me, and that almost hurts the most. Now I've started college, and I fear what the transition will do to me: from a place I know full of people I love who reinforce and help me, to a place that's cold and alone. I often romanticize suicide, just escaping to a mental place where I blow my head off in front of a crowd of people who had contributed to my pain. I struggle with the workload and getting fit (getting fit since I've had monstrosities of inferiority issues for quite some time) and I'm scared that my self loathing, instead of helping me the way I want it to, won't do more than keep me in my room with the utility knife, trying to find a new place that can be easily concealed.

Anyway, first post, kind of rambling, but I just wanted to introduce myself:

I am a genius. I used to have a head about it back in high school; anymore I just feel guilty about it though. My intelligence, my youth, it's a waste.

I originally tested highly on the SAT at 12 (1350ish on the 1600 scale); but then everything really went to shit. Started having some mood level problems in high school, as I became more and more aware of a combination of my loneliness and putting up with severe bullying. My whole self-worth got tied up in a superiority complex. The rednecks could call me anti-gay slurs all they bloody wanted, I was 'better' and it would 'get better' in college; I bought into that a lot. I wanted to believe in it.

Graduated as salutatorian shortly after my 17th birthday. Went to college; and graduated shortly after my 22nd birthday. Truthfully 4 years in a 4 year program; the extra fifth year being because a semester's grades were cancelled after a suicide attempt and I took the following semester off for intensive therapy (school's orders). I slit my wrists, attacked a classmate and was detained by police attempting to hang myself. That was...around my 21st birthday.

I was a C student in college and am very aware if I wasn't naturally intelligent, I would have just plain failed. There were weeks to months were I wouldn't leave my dorm; I couldn't make myself work and I held on by above average work that came in very late. I didn't have much of a social life and I...envied very strongly people that did. Those thoughts would consume me at times; I'd get to nervous to talk to normal people. I'd sit along the edge of one of the upper floors of the foodcourt and people watch.

I know from the quality of my work, when I could get myself to work; that I have a talent for what I love and I -could- be great. And...with these long periods of being unable to work just...makes it feel like my gifts are wasted on me. In two days, I've programmed a complete game from the ground up. In a week, I've made a lifelike model of cerberus. But then, in a year, I've basically done nothing. Nothing practical; nothing to make me happy. Not shit.

I'm now 23. It's been 17 months since I graduated. I haven't left my parent's house in that time at all. At a couple points I promised myself strongly that I would do work for myself that used the skills I learned in the degree and do well with it. I never finished it. Fuck, I never finished trying to make a portfolio website; I never finished applying anywhere. I have a hard time holding up that it matters. It seems like so much time has just...gone. I have no friends. I have no money. I have no prospects. I've been really defeatist subconsciously. Even if I practically know I could make a good game [Degree was a bachelors in game development; a programming/3D art dual-focus thing.]

When you can't manage to keep yourself motivated to work on things YOU CARE ABOUT, trying to work for yourself; I'm not sure if it's really depression or realism when I say 'No, I couldn't hold a job; my work ethic would be too bad.' I feel like I need something GOOD in my life to hold me together in order to EVER be able to focus well enough to get a job or finish a project I care about; but I have to finish the project in order to have those things and... I don't know how to do that.

Even when I was at my 'highest' points. I felt like though I could work, I'd never have real friends and that would hurt me; but I just don't...",depression,t5_2qqqf,Time [Harsh Language Warning]

People kept saying it'd get better, just sort of has not though.  I have a pretty strong sense of willpower, so figured I'd just hang around and not off myself for a while.

This ultimatum is expiring in November.  I decided to give this summer a last hard try, to some bittersweet success.  I met a girl who I laughed, cried, and cuddled with.  She had a German boyfriend I later found out about via her making out with him on a picture on facebook, 78 likes.

I later got invited to celebrate my friends' birthday.  Which was also my birthday.  Everyone knew this via a group celebration in previous years, but forgot this year.  The only person to talk to me really was a girl who I had a really good time with a ten months prior, but she had since started dating a huge jerk in the friend group and was just trying to jump ship back to me.  I was acting really sarcastic because of how upset I was, everyone thought I was just being funny.

More recently I met a friend-of-friends and she took me home from a bar.  That action set off red flags, but I really liked her so continued talking to her / hanging out.  I think I accidentally fell in love with her, or something, based on how devastated I was when I found out she was just using me as a distraction from her demeaning alpha male oil tycoon boyfriend.

I was in the car with her when I realized that it was her boyfriend's apartment I picked her up from that afternoon.  As it sank in, the thick hide I've developed to guard my emotions had started to melt away.  Alas, my subconscious was eating at me and I didn't realize.  Losing sight of your subconcious, I suppose, is happens a lot more easily when you're constantly spacing out to suppress the warning signs you see in someone; all for a desperate need for affection.

I'm a mechanical engineer and I have a car I love, an S2000.  All I wanted to do at that point was hear the engine rev, a sort of self-medicated therapy for someone like me, so I accelerated.  I wouldn't classify this move as outright impulsive, I'm a very conscientious person.  It was something I had done before, and this was about as safe as a scenario could be all-in-all, clear section of road, no cars near, but still ill-advised for obvious reasons.

The cop nailed me for 78 in a 55, my first speeding ticket.  This is classified as reckless driving in Virginia, a class 1 misdemeanor.  You know, mandatory trial, lawyers, that sort of thing.  I luckily did not get charged to that extent, but the hardest hitting portion is how symptomatic it was of my current ""re""decline; of the depth of my carefully guarded problems once that protective layer was gone.

I'm now going to sell that car, although it was honestly the best thing that's happened to me these past few years.  I have a lot of hobbies, though I'm also going to sell most of the stuff I own.  I'm not sure if that's for a primal desire to be free, or to alleviate my fear of burdening the few people I leave behind with all that stuff if and when I off myself.  

I'm going to cut this girl loose, and cry about it.  

I'm going to go to court and plead guilty and tell them the honest truth as I saw it.  I noted the traffic conditions and I was confident I was not putting anyone in harms way besides me and my passenger.  I accelerated for ~10s and decelerated for ~5s to a reasonable speed before the cop's lights were going.  I wasn't acting horrifically rash.

I will tell them that with great power comes great responsibility.  I sacrificed my car, because that evening it became evident that I'm no longer responsible enough to manage the power it comes with.  I will tell them that I ceased to feel guilty about aggressive driving due to how often I almost die on the roads here from other people's much more dangerous choices on the road.  That, in the same regard, I know that other people's poor choices don't allow me to make poor choices.

I want to tell them that I cannot make friends.  That I try to accept too much responsibility, that it's a thankless job.  That I am too empathetic, and it is not reciporicated.  That I hate the generation of yuppies I'm in.  That I can't make good choices with regards to finding affection.

That I just really want to be dead.

I'm ranting about a stupid fucking traffic ticket now.  My situation is rather complex, and this I know better than you.  I know all of this stuff.  I know all of what you can say.  I've analyzed, categorized, etc all of it.  It's been 10 years and that's just what I do all the time.  At this point, it's medical (why's there a giant lesion in my brain?) or biochemical (my family is insane).

Doctors haven't helped and I refuse anti-depressants.

So, good game, I guess nice knowing you.

whatever. F U, Lauren.  Except I feel really sad about saying that.  Thx for at least being near me.

My moods tend to jump around sporadically, alternating between totally normal and lying in my bed sobbing. I don't think I'm particularly suicidal... I don't have any plan in mind, but I've been finding myself fantasizing over, if I were to do it, how I would go about doing it. I've just been so miserable lately that sometimes ending it all seems like the best choice.

Anyways, today I was in another one of those bad moods. I just felt like crying for no reason at all. I decided I'd try and call the hotline... just to see what it was like. After about five minutes on the phone, I hung up, frustrated.

Now, maybe this was a one time thing. Maybe it's not always like that. I DID call a little late in the day (around 11:00 pm), so... I don't know. What I do know is that the person on the other end, whoever she was, sounded like the most insincere, uninterested, uncaring, and just all around unhelpful person ever. I didn't really know what to do. Half the call was just awkward silence, and the person on the other end hardly ever spoke a word. I heard typing on a keyboard in the background, so this woman was clearly preoccupied with something else. She sounded so... disinterested, like she was being forced to do it for volunteer credits or some bullshit like that.

I don't really know what I was expecting. I thought I'd give it a try, but after that call, I'm convinced that if I ever were to go through with suicide, calling that number would be of no benefit whatsoever. Was this a one time thing? If so, what does a typical call usually sound like? Does anybody have any positive experiences to share about the suicide hotline?",depression,t5_2qqqf,Called the suicide help hotline today for the first time...

I already posted lots and lots here. I still have not learned that this is useless, but I’m still doing it. But this is my last one, I promise. Read it or not, it’s just my way of saying goodbye.

I can’t stand the loneliness anymore, and the fact that there’s nothing I can do about it is more than enough for me to wrap everything up. I mean, I’m a fat ugly loser with the shittiest personality ever. I can find myself to care about anybody or anything anymore. 

I want friends, but nobody will endure all my negativity and the fact that I have such a hard time to care about people does not help either. I want a girlfriend, but my ugly face will prevent me from getting one that physically attract me (and don’t say that look doesn’t matter, cause it god damn does, learned it the hard way in school), and to be fair, I can’t even take care of myself, so taking care of another human being is out of question. I can’t go out since I’ve lost all motivation to do anything. I have no talent what so ever, no passion, no goal, and I have no self esteem / confidence.

I’ve lived these past five years alone in my room, in the dark cause I usually live at night, people and noise tire me. People tire me because I then have to go over the same shitty conversation again and again, and it always ends up in them telling me that I shouldn’t worry about this or this and cheer up. Some of them tell me to go see a doctor, well guess what? I did, and they don’t care. I’ve been waiting since June for a call (psychiatrist), still nothing. It’s like they’re testing you. They want to see how much you can fucking wait until you finally try to suicide. Well guess what asshole, I don’t need to try. When you get hit by a train at 50 mph, you can be fucking sure that I won’t have to hear any of your shitty tips and blabbering after that.

Blabbering like;

''What do you actually want in life?''. I want nothing in life, what the fuck do you think I want to suicide for? Curiosity? I want to stop existing because I see no point in being an antisocial, emotionless, ugly loser. I will never get friends. I won’t get any job. I mean I’m already practically fucking dead, might as well make it official.

''You’re not alone in this''. Oh yeah, how come everybody that once was my friend stabbed me in the back in the end? They stabbed me in the back at school because they thought I was too weak to defend myself against the bullies. They stabbed me in the back when they thought I was being too pessimistic and that they’ve had enough with me being negative all the time. And my family… My brothers give no fucks about what could ever happen to me. My mother’s 59 and is taking care of my sister who’s borderline, which has two kids, one of them being autistic, and she has a selfish manipulative ex boyfriend, but since she’s borderline, she has trouble letting him go (she thirsts for affection / attention). My dad, who’s not my real dad, my real dad died when I was nine. He adopted me when I was 14 years old when my mom met him, they divorced a year later. He 64 and has a really bad opinion about mental illness. He tried to force me to go out by making me feel guilty or something; he bought me a 1500$ electric scooter. It’s been a month, and I have yet to try it.

''Call a suicide hotline''. And explain my whole story for the 47th time to somebody that doesn’t know me at all that has to listen to all the negativity and pessimism inside me? They don’t care. They act like they do, but it’s completely stupid. A random stranger on the phone telling me to not kill myself because… well because it’s there job is not going to do anything. I’ve also heard a lot of bad things about suicide hotlines, like them saying inappropriate things to people suffering with depression (like this guy that just wanted to chat, and the lady told him that this was not the place. Or this recent post about the guy that called a hotline and the lady hung up on him, twice, glad he found it funny though). And beside that, I want to die, disappear. I’m not going to call Patrick and tell him that’s I’ll be gone in 2 minutes.

''We will get you out of this''. No you’re not. Three months later, still nothing. Good job doctor, you did a great job. Adieu.

''Think positively, think of all the good things you have''. Okay. I have a roof over my head. I have a computer and fast internet. Thank god for all of this, I would have ended it way sooner. Now to think positively of this: What is a roof, computer and internet is going to do for me? Fuck all. I’m a waste of electricity, food and money overall. Want to know my greatest achievement in life? I got gold on an online video game named League of Legends. Go for it. Tell me how positive this is; tell me how good of a future I fucking have. Tell me how much this actually matter right now in my shitty life. I mean, you don’t even know what it means.

I don’t even want medication. It’s not going to make my shitty face prettier, or remove the fat out of my body. It’s not going to make my bones stronger or magically fix my lazy eye. It’s not going to make me care about people, and thus will not give me friends.

There’s no other option. I’m going to go to my mom’s house next week-end, like I just want to visit her for a short time and then go back to my dad’s house, but in reality, I just want to be closer to the metro. It’ll be quick, I might feel pain for a couple seconds, but it will be all worth it in the end. I’m scared though. I’m scared and sad. Scared because I don’t know what will happen next, and sad because all I wanted was to be able to make friends, friends that will be there for me when I need them the most…

I’ve learned things in life, and even if I won’t remember any of this in whatever may come next, I’ve learned that people will fuck you up. I’ve learned that if you’re ugly, shy, and scared of defending yourself, you’re not going to make it out. I’ve learned that friends, well... they aren’t always friends. Some will pretend to be your friend, and then stab you in the back through your heart and finish you off. I’ve learned that people think that the brain has no flaw, that everything is controllable. I’ve learned that, until you actually are planning in doing it, nobody will hear your cries for help. But when they finally realize what’s actually happening, that your brain is already too fucked up to go back, it’s too late.

I still have until Saturday. I’ll keep it quiet, I’m on a roller coaster of emotions right now, I’m scared, sad, impatient, but at the same time, happy, because I can’t help but feel that this is the only way out.",depression,t5_2qqqf,I'll end it this week-end.

I guess the argument can be made that organisms are willing to give everything for their lives, thus they are important. But animals lack what we humans have: introspection and foresight.

Animals sleep when they are tired, hunt or graze when they are hungary, shelter when they are cold, they have no concept of schedules or plans. Even thinking of living in the now as a modern human is impossible.

Im getting off track a little. What I mean to say is: what if its OK to not like life and to want to quit whilst your ahead? You can try the orange but if you don't like it why keep eating them?

So in high school I had few friends but they were decent. One, who we will call Bree because that's her name, is just the best person in the world. She wouldn't give up on me; no matter what. I had tried to kill myself at the end of last year but she saw herself to blame and I didn't want to hurt her so I tried to block contact. Every month or 2 she would send a message and I'd try and eliminate any contact because she deserves so much better. Also, because I was/am in love with her. 

I know it can't ever happen but she's just so caring and beautiful I needed to stay away because I would likely hurt her if she actually felt the same way. Which she doesn't. 

I told her I'm not good enough for her so I've been trying to get better but she said, basically, if that's the reason then don't bother because we are just friends. This hurt a lot. 

These combined are just making me fall again and I feel sick constantly. I really needed to get it off my chest but I'm so lost as to what I need to do.

You probably guessed it but from me posting here but I have social anxiety, a big part of it is being terrified of being wrong or not knowing something. Although I don't think it will be as bad since I'm just following a script - asking questions and clicking/typing their response but there will still be people who are angry you called, or are drunk, or dont speak the language very well.. variables that make me anxious.

The job isn't horrible but the times are like.. 16:00 - 21:00 which are meh.. also I hear it can be quite stressful and the employers will get annoyed and whine if you don't complete x interviews an hour, and will tell you that you need to make up for it on your next shift.
But hey.. it's work experience.. I guess..

""Tomorrow""(it's 3 am here) I have to go to the company for training(around 16:30 so I have time to sleep still).. and I am really nervous. They will probably have us do fake calls and/or listen in to calls and judge us.. I'm quite nervous.. although a part of me knows I shouldn't be that nervous.. anxiety comes in waves I guess.

Gonna be honest here.. Kind of posted this to have some people wish me good luck and tell me everything is gonna be ok somehow.. also it just felt good to type things out. Maybe someone has some tips to quell my anxiety or has worked in a similar job before and has some tips?

that's all bad enough. but what's really killing me in the short term is i can't stop obsessively reiterating these scenarios in my head that'll never happen in reality. they usually have to do with inflicting some kind of emotional harm on my ex or showing him up. there's a handful of them that i repeat over and over and i can't stop. they're incredibly pathetic and it embarasses me to even write these down in a public forum but i want to show you what i mean.

for example-
-i imagine running into him in public (i haven't seen him in the eight months since he left) and telling him that if he doesn't get away from me i'll make him regret it.
-i imagine being with a group of friends and seeing him and that my friends help me insult him until he gets upset and leaves.
-i imagine that he calls me up to apologize again (he does this every few months) and i tell him any number of things, such as that i know he's just apologizing to rationalize to himself that he's a good person and that it's not really for my benefit, or that he hurt me too badly for an apology to mean jack shit, etc etc.
-imagining that he tries to talk to me and continues talking despite no response, then i throw water in his face or something equally childish and walk away.

you get the drift. really sad movie script fantasies that i guess are some pathetic attempt to make me feel better about myself.

my question is, how do i stop these from constantly running in my head? i know that thinking about him only prolongs my pain, and i know i'm being an immature piece of shit for not accepting his decision.

I read the rules on the side and it says not to post anything explicit about self harm, and I completely understand why, but I don't think there's really a vague way to really get my point across.  That said, if this is in violation of rules, instead of just deleting/locking/whatever this post (it's fine if that happens) but can you please point me to the proper place to pose this question?  Thank you.  
  
I have hurt myself before, and I honestly enjoy doing it two different ways (well, not *enjoy* but I find it to be effective two different ways that I won't go into detail about, as per the rules) but I often times, when I'm beating myself up mentally, on top of all the insults to myself and all that, I think of things I want done to myself (and it's specifically done **TO** me, not me doing them to myself, although it could go either way, but I usually think about it being administered to me) that are either extremely improbable or impossible.  
  
For sake of at least attempting to be vague, some of them are very Spanish Inquisition-like in how extreme they are.  Many would kill me and be torturous but others would just wound or mame me.  Some are very American Psycho-like.  Some things (sorry if this is too explicit for here) are impossible, like wanting the blood in my veins to turn to barbed wire and basically tear all of my veins, or having layers of my body torn away (skin first, then veins, then nerves, then muscle, then bones cracked open and marrow dug out) and things like that.  
  
I guess what I'm wondering is if anyone else does this?  These things don't really bring me relief or pleasure at all, the opposite really, they just make me feel like shit, and I know if I were to *actually* be in a situation like this I'd quickly change my tune on wanting these things to happen to me.. but I feel like I'm completely fucking psychotic even thinking of these things and I honestly have no idea where they come from.  I think I suffer from depression, but I don't cry uncontrollably or never laugh or never have a good time or anything like that.  Perhaps my understanding of depression is misguided, but, I'm just really afraid of being psychotic.  I intend to discuss this with my psychiatrist when I see her next week, but, I just wanted to know if I was alone in these kinds of thoughts or not.

When you’re depressed, when everything around you…stops, when, no matter how many things are moving around you, you and the air across your skin don’t move, when all your favorite foods are ash, all your favorite movies are dull, and all your favorite music is white noise; that’s when you realize certain things.

When you’re depressed; you realize how long the hall is, you realize how many wrinkles are in your hand, you realize how hard it is to pull breath into your lungs, you realize the shock of your heel on the pavement, you realize how much energy you use to get up and go home, you realize how a mechanical pen works, you realize how much you slouch, you realize how many steps you take in a day, you feel all of the water droplets hitting you in the shower, you feel the blow of the knife hitting the plate after it passes through the meet, and you feel…nothing…at the same, exact time.

Ambience…has ceased. All else…is dark. An hour can be two minutes…or three days. Sleep…becomes your main pastime. And genres, categories, organization, rituals, ceremonies, customs become…hollow.

You hurt your friends; you hurt your family; you hurt yourself.

Some want to kill themselves; some just want to stop existing; some cut open there skin; some hide in corners; some cry; some stare; some go to others with their problems; some say “I’m fine.”

It’s hard to continue when you don’t see an end goal. That’s really what most of living is, anyway: just living until you reach the next point you were looking forward to. But, when all seems to be floating around, suspended in a stale air, you can’t see the next point.

Why continue, when you don’t know when you’ll get there, when you don’t know if there’s a “there” to get to. You could just get to the end…the true end…right now…I mean, really: where’s the next point in life that makes it worth living again? You’re alone, you’re tired, you’re failing, or you’re bored…there’s not much left to do…

…

…Well…that cool movie’s coming out next month…and you still have a DVD of your favorite classic. Plus, your favorite band’s new EP is gonna be released soon. You could just go home and listen to them again for old time’s sake. And your Netflix account just got renewed and their supposed to add the new season of your favorite show. Look at that, there’s a coupon for your favorite restaurant, and that girl just smiled at you, and Christmas is only a couple months away…

…

…maybe sticking around isn’t that bad of an idea…the hallway isn’t that long, you’d love to see how a mechanical pencil worked, you actually like that feeling of a knife hitting a plate, and, if you don’t think about, pulling air into your lungs isn’t that hard.

Yeah…maybe you’ll hold off for a while…there are some pretty cool things left…

Sad, worthless, hopeless, darkness, everything associated with depression, BUT

Also can feel esctatic when doing certain tasks, such as playing video games and meeting friends

First of, my grandmother died by the start of this week, and I couldn't take even one day off my work because my fucking bosses left on vacation and put my in charge, then my car broke and I don't have the money to repair it, so I used my sister car and guess what it broke down too!, ok maybe because those cars are old ( 10+ ) so I am going to ask my boss to use the company car for two days till I fix one of the cars I have, GUESS WHAT !!! IT BROKE TOO !!!! AND I AM NOT THE ONE TO BLAME, JUST A FUCKING MECHANICAL THING !!!!

Ok, fuck I just borrow few bucks and I fixed one of my cars thank god, it's working for few days now and everything seems fine. 

one of the bosses came back, and as I was in-charge I was collecting payment out of costumers and paying the daily expense, alright everything seems fine, recalculated everything and all seems fine, I handled my boss the amount I had, explained for him everything happened while they were away, 2 hours later it seems there is 100$ more than what it is supposed to be !! he didn't say a shit, but I know deep down inside he is thinking I am not trustworthy! fuck my life. 

yesterday, I tried to do my job! I have a lot of thing to do, but noooo my boss think what I need to do is not that important but I need to do a fucking something which would take time, AND IT CAN BE DONE BY ANY OTHER EMPLOYER BUT NOOOO I AM THE ONE WHO NEED TO DO IT. 

So now, I have 2 days to do task that would normally take 3 days ! I will try to finish them as fast as possible, and I hope he don't think that he can give me another shitty long process  task that can be done by any other employee

I am broke now, under depth I don't want to borrow any more money but I think I will as my salary is in 3 days but I don't have a fucking penny, I am really broke 

as all this shitty things happen I keep remembering that I don't have any  shoulder to cry on, nether do I have anyone to take too about the shit I am facing, AND ALL I AM THINKING NOW THAT I AM 25 YEARS OLD VIRGIN WHO DIDN'T FUCKING HAVE ANY GIRL FRIEND IN MY LIFE ! I know it's my fault, I was ashamed of my self as I was a fat fuck in my teen and I am now mature with no game or how to talk to the other sex ! 

I hate my life, I hate my self, I don't want to go back to what I was few months ago, suicidal thought ! 


The only think that holding me from committing suicide is my religious believes, I don't know how much long that would hold me back, if life keep fucking with me the same way as it is doing to me now

Now I feel like the ground has been taken from underneath me and I'm just flailing around. I have no idea what I want to do- apart from studying which costs money. I was going to do an accountancy course but now I can't justify using my last bit of money on it. If the pressure wasn't enough, I have to support my boyfriend financially as he's doing a masters so I'm covering rent.

To happen at this time of year as well just really hits home how lost I am. Everywhere I look people are going back to uni or getting new jobs or even having children and I'm just, there. For god knows how long as well. Last time I ended up working for months in a minimum wage retail job which was soul destroying as I couldn't afford to go to law school and didn't have enough work experience.

I hate that I'm jealous of my boyfriend for getting onto a course he worked bloody hard for. I hate that I was just starting to come out of my shell and then my confidence was shattered. I hate that I have to tell a therapist all of this shit as well as the fact my anxiety has been near crippling lately.

I know everyone has this at some point so I shouldn't complain. I just thought that part was over, at least for a bit longer. The thought of getting back onto that hamster wheel of applying and getting rejected for jobs while everyone around me succeeds is enough to make it not worth waking up for.",depression,t5_2qqqf,Here we go again.

I've been depressed for about 1 and 2/3 years and have been recovering from my all time low back in March. I've never had a problem with making friends, but always a problem with staying focused in school. I thought for sure that college would be another experience like that. Fuck, I've never been so wrong before. I have the highest grade in 3 out of my 5 classes, have done really well to study, and have just been focused all throughout this first month. I'm excited that despite 4 years of not doing shit that I can keep this up.

On the other hand, I went to a school all the way across the state. I know no one here. 36,000 kids and don't know a single soul. Surely with that many people I'd make at least one friend right? Nope, not even my 3 roommates. Oh I hate 2 of them a lot too. One is the most entitled, opinionated, arrogant asshole I've ever had the pleasure of meeting. He is loud, complains all the time, and on top of all that, what bothers me most for some odd reason, is his shitty taste in music. I swear to God, if I hear Nicki Minaj one more time, I'm gonna go Vincent Van Gogh on both my ears. The other one I hate for the fact that she never stops drinking, is also loud, and is extremely ignorant, I can't even imagine how she got into college. The third is fine. She's a little loud, but can be quiet, she isn't always drunk and at least respects me if I ask for things to calm down so I can do my homework.
I'm sure I wouldn't have noticed this that much if I had friends to hang out with, but my only chance was with club soccer, and I missed the team by one player (26th out of 25 selected).   I never noticed these things often in people when I had friends around, but now I'm judging everyone. I feel like a dick. I mean, I'm the one who's fucked up in the head, why do I get to judge others?

The whole social aspect of college is tearing me apart. I can't even cry because I have no where to do it. The counseling service here is mediocre at best and haven't helped me with anything yet. I just want to go home. I want to see my dogs. I always had them when ever I was like this. I could walk them or cuddle or whatever, but I have nothing now. Learning how to cope in college is like learning how to walk again. That wasn't fun for me when I literally had to learn again. I fucking need help. I'm desperate. I can't be the only one who has gone through this. Please, please, please help me. I'm scared I might go back to March. I'm terrified!

Loneliness and inferiority is killing me. It's like I'm not a real person.

I'm really scared and wondering what I did wrong. I'm 22 and have never had any relationships or intimacy. I was subject to varying degrees of bullying for most of my youth and have been depressed for close to 10 years. You can check my past submissions for more info.  The short version is that when I see anyone who I think I might like I automatically assume that they are way too good for me and I would just embarrass myself if I talked to them. I know I should just ""man up"", and ignore that bullshit but the fear and inadequacy is overwhelming. I have tried to defeat this logically for a long time now but my feelings are just stronger than my logic. 
Jealousy is also a huge part of it. Knowing or even just seeing people who can have heaps of great relationships or even just casual sex while I'm unable to be with anyone just makes me feel worse.

I know this is a stupid thing to say but I have this crazy idea that nobody takes me and my situation seriously. Like other people can talk about their problems with people and be given advice and sympathy but times I've tried to talk to friends about my loneliness they just seem to dismiss it. Even just the way people like me are portrayed in movies or online is all negative. There's no sympathy for the ""forever alone"", only ridicule. I know this is a stupid thing to get upset about, but the feeling that I'm one if those losers who everyone mocks and nobody feels sorry for really gets to be

I'm really just looking for any help or advice you can give me. I'm seriously at the end of my rope here and thoughts of suicide are becoming quite frequent. I don't really respond well to ""brutal honestly"" but I'll take it if you think it's what I need.

I really want to get over this bullshit and be able to think of myself as an equal to others, not as scum. And I want to do it soon before I do anything stupid.
                                              
 My confidence is also pretty non-existent. I worry about what everyone will think about every choice I make. I can't even go clothes shopping without getting paranoid that people won't like the clothes I buy.

Thanks in advance

Probably should mention I have had counseling in the past, and have been seeing a psychiatrist weekly since December. I'm currently taking 150mg of Movox each night. If there are any other helpful details just let me know.

Sure, they're not always particularly happy but at least they've got each other there. I have none of that. I get more social interaction making dick jokes in twitch chats than I do anywhere else. I feel so alone.

My family are here for me, sure. I'm lucky I've got people who care about me, want to know how and what I'm doing, make sure it's okay. But they're just my family, a group of people who don't really have a choice. The only thing they share with me is chance, it just so happens that we're related. I guess they could have been horrible people and I'm very lucky that they're not monsters, but there was almost always going to be someone there. I feel like I need more connection than that with people, though.

Everyone else has friends in it. They've got friends on the same course at uni, or who live or work in the same place. People who have the same hobbies and do the same things.

Am I wrong? Have I been lied to by television and music and comics about the importance and benefits of friendship? Is my brain lying to me, telling me I suck because I don't have these friends, telling me that friendships exist at all? Or do I just suck? Have I got all I ever need in a family that are good to me? I'm certainly pretty lucky, maybe I'm just a greedy fucking shithead having an internal tantrum because he doesn't have more people who care for him.

That's not rhetorical. I want to know if I'm a fucking wasteful piece of shit or if having more people to talk to, share with, understand are actually important to having a good life and being happy. Don't sugarcoat it because you think I need to be stepped lightly around in case I do something dumb or because I'm posting in some support group where everyone has to be nice and encouraging or some shit.

I wrote a narration about depression and I'm just trying to find out if it works.


When you’re depressed, when everything around you…stops, when, no matter how many things are moving around you, you and the air across your skin don’t move, when all your favorite foods are ash, all your favorite movies are dull, and all your favorite music is white noise; that’s when you realize certain things.

When you’re depressed; you realize how long the hall is, you realize how many wrinkles are in your hand, you realize how hard it is to pull breath into your lungs, you realize the shock of your heel on the pavement, you realize how much energy you use to get up and go home, you realize how a mechanical pen works, you realize how much you slouch, you realize how many steps you take in a day, you feel all of the water droplets hitting you in the shower, you feel the blow of the knife hitting the plate after it passes through the meet, and you feel…nothing…at the same, exact time.

Ambience…has ceased. All else…is dark. An hour can be two minutes…or three days. Sleep…becomes your main pastime. And genres, categories, organization, rituals, ceremonies, customs become…hollow.

You hurt your friends; you hurt your family; you hurt yourself.

Some want to kill themselves; some just want to stop existing; some cut open there skin; some hide in corners; some cry; some stare; some go to others with their problems; some say “I’m fine.”

It’s hard to continue when you don’t see an end goal. That’s really what most of living is, anyway: just living until you reach the next point you were looking forward to. But, when all seems to be floating around, suspended in a stale air, you can’t see the next point.

Why continue, when you don’t know when you’ll get there, when you don’t know if there’s a “there” to get to. You could just get to the end…the true end…right now…I mean, really: where’s the next point in life that makes it worth living again? You’re alone, you’re tired, you’re failing, or you’re bored…there’s not much left to do…

…

…Well…that cool movie’s coming out next month…and you still have a DVD of your favorite classic. Plus, your favorite band’s new EP is gonna be released soon. You could just go home and listen to them again for old time’s sake. And your Netflix account just got renewed and their supposed to add the new season of your favorite show. Look at that, there’s a coupon for your favorite restaurant, and that girl just smiled at you, and Christmas is only a couple months away…

…

…maybe sticking around isn’t that bad of an idea…the hallway isn’t that long, you’d love to see how a mechanical pencil worked, you actually like that feeling of a knife hitting a plate, and, if you don’t think about, pulling air into your lungs isn’t that hard.

Yeah…maybe you’ll hold off for a while…there are some pretty cool things left…",depression,t5_2qqqf,A Narration of Depressive Life. [Resubmission]

ATM I'm in High School, Junior year to be exact and well life just isn't looking so great. To my own fault I tried to keep up with the smart kids to make my parents happy and feel smart but that just fucked me over from the start of high school. My grades Progressed downwards from a 3.3/3.4 to what is now a 2.1 In life I guess I've just been a really quiet person and  to be honest lack social skills. Don't get me wrong I can make conversation and talk to people but outside of school I really have no real friends except for a few people I hung out with over the years who I guess I can consider my really good friends. Within the past 2 years or so they all kind of started smoking, drinking and party all which I choose to avoid due to lack of money and fear of getting in trouble at an already shake homelife. In retrospect thats were I think things went downhill for me. While I was staying home doing really nothing they were out meeting new people making friends and progressing in there lives. Eventually I gave in to the pressure and depression of lonliness and I too began smoking which allowed me to hang out more but after a good 2 months I realized alot of things. Those things being
1.  I really don't fit in with them anymore and it kills me inside because I used to be really good friends with them but i guess because I failed to hang out with them the last few years they've grown acustomed to not being/dealing with me and learned to not really need me in their circle. 
2.  In those few years they made friends with other people who I don't know. Those new people don't really like me I guess cause I'm quiet and not really that much fun to be around cause I'm shy/weary around new suspicious people.
3.  We all have different ambitions/outlooks on life. I'm more of a quiet calm collected person while they all are into partying, chasing girls and I guess just doing dumb shit like messing around with drugs(nothing to serious) and trying to break laws to be cool or something. 
4.   I don't think I can ever really fit in with them anymore and I honestly have no clue what to do. It's too late into my highschool life to really make any new friends. As dumb as it sounds its true. I got to a school full of rich and smart people and party druggies/jocks. I just don't fit in. I'm friendly with everybody but not really close friends with anybody. It sucks when I came to realize that. Nobody wants to talk to me and when people do I'll talk back and try to socialize but I'm a boring person and i run out of stuff to say quick. I never smile or show signs of being a fun person and it blows. 
5.   Sucide really comes across my mind daily. I know some people might say I need help but there's nobody i can ask without really fucking my life up. I tried talking to my parents but all they did was brush it off and act like I don't have a problem because my life isn't as hard as their's when they were my age. I hate who I am, I hate how I've done nothing product ive with my life. I hate how my parents/family is so disfunctional I hate how I never really had a chance to be normal. 

I guess im just venting at this point but to be completely honest the fact that all of my friends have moved on without me really just eats me up on the inside and I hate it. I just hate life right now. Has anyone been in a situation like this? If so what did you do to carry on in life?

I have completely lost my will to live, to exist. It's a sad realization, as not too long ago I still had it. The spark. The glorious flame of life burned bright. Everything was well. In my own apartment, I lived in content. No longer.

The days have become agony. Every passing hour worse than the one before it. I have nothing to do, nothing to look forward to. No one to talk to, no one talks to me. No that I would tell anyone how I feel if they asked. But they won't. If I had legs I could run away; if I had arms I could kill myself; if I had a mouth I could talk to be some kind of company to myself. All those and more I have, yet nothing matters anymore. Not that I am suicidal. I just don't want to live. If there was a way out I would take it, but there isn't one. No release from this torment.

The worst part of this is the loneliness. For some reason I have to be the one to initiate conversation. And I can't, I simply can't start bashing on about how I feel, nobody wants to listen to that. I know too well how depression is a burden to loved ones as well. I have been told I am too kind, so maybe it is the kindness that keeps me from coming clean about how I feel.

""You think too much"" is another thing I've been told. How true it is. I can't escape my own thoughts. They haunt me, throughout the day, so that I sleep 12 hours a night. Sleep is my only respite. And is death nothing but endless sleep? Eternal respite.

I want to tell the world and just get it out there, but at the same time I don't want anyone to know. I want to be alone most of the time. I just don't know how to deal with this. Here I am again, writing out my feelings; hating every moment I  continue to breathe. So here it is. Everything I've been through and everything wrong with me. This is long and will probably contain run on sentences, so bear with me.

I'm going to start my story slightly more than a year ago, when an amazing girl asked me out. Being the oblivious, childish, nerdy guy I was, I figured this moment, based on what I had learned through unrealistic Hollywood high school role models, never should have been real. Yet, it was. So, first date at a small run down amusement park, I was extremely nervous. Questioning the whole thing. We got close, having had the entire summer to get to know each other. Closing the date with a final ride on the Farris wheel, I put my arm around her. We held hands walking out to the parking lot. I couldn't drive other people around yet, so we waited for her ride to get there. The night drew to a close with us walking to her car, a goodbye hug, and everyone going home.

I only emphasize the first two dates in this story due to their massive significance as events in my life. The second date was different in a few ways. Dinner and a movie, another typical date idea, apparently. Double date. For someone brand new to dating, it was a bit weird. We went to Buffalo Wild Wings and saw World War Z. I was nervous again and trying to show off a little, so I bought a huge bucket of popcorn. It didn't get eaten very much. After the date we were standing outside the theater, again waiting for her ride. We stared deeply into each other's eyes, she had the most beautiful eyes, then I would awkwardly look around. I wasn't sure how to approach this situation. As her ride arrived and they started to walk away, she walked back, looked me straight in the eyes, and we kissed. My first kiss.

I remember the rest of the time we were together very clearly. I remember our third date. We went bowling. Afterwards, for one of the last times, we were waiting for her ride, sitting in the back of my truck making out. It started to rain, just light enough to make it one of the most romantic things I'd ever experienced. When it looked like it was going to get worse, we sat inside my truck and made out some more until her mom came to pick her up. 

It lasted slightly longer than three months. July 31st to November 11th. She broke up with me that night in an akward text conversation. I was upset--no--devastated. I tried so hard to get her to stay. But she didn't... I was lost... I don't know how to live without her. I tried coping by attempting to be friends. It seemed to be okay. Until I said something I still regret today. She Forgave me about a week later. She started dating someone else. We stopped talking for a while. That guy almost killed himself with drugs on accident. I honestly kinda hoped he would finish the job. 

Anyways, she eventually decided that for some reason I was the person she would ask for advice. This girl we knew was cheating on this guy we knew and she didn't know what to do besides abusing my kind-hearted, honest nature, get me to tell the guy. I think she probably knew I would do anything she asked when she came to me. So I'm still obsessed, both at this point in the story and now. She lead me on for a while after that. I finally just asked her straight up if there was any chance she would get back together with me, and she said that there probably wasn't. It got really awkward.

I almost killed myself 3 times in the last couple months of that school year. One of those times was actually at prom. I don't want to talk about what stopped me, at least not in this sentence. So, throwing in a piece of shitty comedy, I'll do it in the next sentence. I met a pretty cool college girl who was probably the only reason I didn't dive headfirst off the balcony at prom, however she just became a whole new problem.

I digress. And so the girl who ripped my still beating heart out graduated, leaving me with one more year of high school. I've talked to her a few times since then and half regretted every time. It's my last year. I'm finishing up high school. Whoopty-fucking-doo. But I don't really think I'm going to make it through this year. Every day I get worse and worse. I find it hard to talk to people. So I've tried and failed at therapy. I'm literally obsessed with her. Like a drug addict is obsessed with getting his fix. On my mind all the time. If I make it through to when I turn 18, I plan on mathematically calculating the lottery numbers and, probably, winning. The money would then be divided amongst my family and friends. I would then commit suicide and be done with everything. It would make everything clean.",depression,t5_2qqqf,I needed to post this…

I guess this post is just to talk about things or vent. It's probably going to be long. I don't really know where to start. When I was little my biological mother and father weren't the best. My biological mom did drugs and alcohol, and ran into a poll with me in the car as an infant. Because of this, I was supposed to be taken away from her.  However, no official adoption happened until I was around nine. I lived with my grandparents on my biological moms side and still do, but I always visited my biological mother and father. I loved visiting my biological father, until he got a fiance. She was extremely mean, and though this may sound cliche, she treated me similar to Cinderella with her two daughters. Her two daughters mistreated me. They took my allowance, got me in trouble, and other things. She always got mad at me and made me do most of the chores for no reason, and used belts on me occasionally when she was angry. She even left me in the corner for ""time out"" ALL NIGHT until my biological father got home. One day, around when I was seven I believe, my father called my grandparents and said he wanted nothing to do with me. He sent my toys and never spoke to us again. I had to go to required therapy for years. My biological mom made up mean stories about my grandma, and lied about having custody of me for money. She also lied about her past, which ended up causing me to lie a lot too as a young girl. She said things like, our family is witches, I was a model, and we're princesses. She actually meant these lies. My grandparents officially adopted me around when I was nine. I am very thankful for this, but. My grandma is kind of mean. She manipulates just as much as my biological mom and lies a lot, just less obviously. She tells me I'm terrible everyday, but in front of other people, she brags about me. She always gets mad at me when I don't believe I have done anything wrong. My grandpa used to stand with me in some situations, but now he just goes along with her no matter what. I'm always in trouble. I'm an almost all A student, with lots of extra activities, I don't ever get in trouble at school. I just don't understand. I always feel terrible because of it. My grandma always flips out and screams at me in stores. I never used to scream back but lately I have. Then all the people there think I am the problem. I can't handle it. 8 years ago (I'm 16), my biological mother had my little sister, apparently planned her appearence to be blond with blue eyes, she wanted a kid like that, and didn't like me because I wasn't. I got to see my biological mom a bit so I would see my sister. I love my sister. But my biological mom always blew up on me online. A common example was on prom night. I was literally AT PROM, and she had a multiple page rant on how I am a crappy daughter because she doesn't have a physical copy of official prom pictures in her hand. The pictures literally didn't have time to be loaded on to the computer, I wasn't even home. HOW could I send them. She had done this for years. Finally I went off on her that prom. Then she hated me and told me I would never see my sister again. She ended up sharing all my facebook posts and liking everything and trying to talk to me, but I ignored her. Then I posted a performence picture, (I'm a singer), and she went off again because I didn't tell her where the show was. Even though she has no car, and can't get there, nor would she be welcomed due to her and my grandmas rivalry. She told me not to answer, so I didn't since I was already ignoring her. I normally only see my sister every few months, so I guess at first the loss didn't register until recently. The day after my birthday, my biological mom messaged me a huge rant about how shitty I am, and how she is never talking to me again. She told me to read my bible because I need to and that I am just like grandma. My biological mom believes she has found god, though all she does is lie. My grandma says I'm like my biological mom. I can't handle any of this. My biological mom blocked me on facebook and deleted my contact in all ways. She made sure I knew that she would tell my little sister how terrible I am. At school, I am a big choir and theatre person. But the choir teacher mistreats me. She made fun of my solo and ensemble pieces, screams at me for no reason, and doubts everything I say, even though I've been trained in music and theatre since a very young age and I lead her choir section. She is always disgusted when I talk to her. I try so hard to impress her because thats the only way you can get into the musicals. I'm in a drama class now, so I can work with the director, but the kids in the class are mean to me. They are all choir kids too, and it seems as though they've picked up on the choir teachers behavior. They ignored me any time I said hello over the summer, and I try to be friendly in school too, but the majority of them ignore me completely or hate me. They aren't supportive in class, and this class is the only shot I have to get in another musical. I haven't been in one since I left my Arts middle/elementary school because of the choir teacher. I don't have many friends because of this. I had one best friend of 8 years, but over the summer she basically completely betrayed me. Admitted it, then lied about doing it, and her mom went off on me. Recently she says she is sorry for it, and we've started to talk again. She was in an abusive relationship and it upset her a lot. I'm still a bit skeptical of the situation just by natural reaction, but I believe she really means she is sorry. I keep having moments when I can't breath. I can't catch my breath and I just cry and hyper ventalate over stupid things like a presentation in drama since people don't like me. I can't calm myself down and it's terrifying. I also loose concentration and zone out for an hour without knowing, but according to other people during that time I respond in conversation and do stuff without knowing. Also after something bad happens at home I tell my boyfriend, but then the next day when he makes sure i'm okay I don't remember it happening. I try really hard and it feels like the event is a dream. I have self harmed  since seventh grade and I'm a junior now. I never had the guts to kill myself until recently. I almost did once, but my boyfriend is the only one who knows about all of this and he helped me out of it. As naive as it may seem, we have been dating for a bit over a year and a half and he is the only one who has cared about me and that I have told all of this. I almost kill myself every now and then, because I just want things to stop. I obsess over dumb things such as, if I knock a paper off a table, I will want to cry and think about it for a month. I can't go to therapy because of my grandparents and I guess I just wanted to vent. Again, sorry for the length. ",depression,t5_2qqqf,This is mostly to rant.. (LONG)

I'm a guy who is currently 17 years old, and I'm in my final year of high school. I intend on going to university for engineering next year. I've got the marks going. This is my grade 12 year. I should be enjoying it, having fun, hanging out with friends. But, I'm not. I'm hating it so much.

Ever since the beginning of 2014, everything for me in my social life has been going downhill. It all started once my closest friends started to make plans without me. It didn't get to me at first, because I've always been one to enjoy the feeling of solitude. However, this wonderful feeling of solitude turned into loneliness very quickly. I turned to other friends, but they cast me away as well.

At that point, the only one friend I had left was my long-distance girlfriend who I had been with for a year. I was head over heels for her. Not too long later, she cheated, and dumped me when I was on break at work, via text. That hit me hard. It put the feeling of heaviness in my chest, and it hasn't gone away since. It really got to me at that point. I became even more isolated and alone. My family made it worse. Poked fun at me for not having any friends and telling me to ""get over it"". Absolutely horrible. All I wanted was a hug at that point. I haven't had a hug in almost half a year.

Summer rolled in. I took one of my grade 12 math courses over the summer. I tried to make new friends there, but it didn't work. I seldom talked to anyone. I felt like an outcast there too. Everyone there already knew each other, and I was cast to the side once again.

At one point in July, to my surprise, someone asked me to hang out. I almost cried, because it was the only time I had done something with someone outside of school since January. On that day, it was the best I felt for a long time.

Grade 12 started almost a month ago. I'm having the same problems, except worse. People actually seem to be going out of their way to avoid me, even those who I don't really know. I don't even stay at school for lunch anymore because I don't sit with anyone. I used to be in the school band, but I quit because everyone in it seemed very hostile towards me.

At this point, I don't hang out with anyone at all, and hardly talk to anyone. I spend every night alone and depressed. Nowhere to go on the weekends. I try to talk to people but they usually just ignore me. I don't even play video games anymore because I'm too depressed to get motivated to do even the slightest thing. My family seems to have taken on the idea that I'm their punching bag (not a literal, physical punching bag). They're always slinging insults left and right, and it's breaking me down, but I never show it because they'll keep doing it more. They hardly ever take me seriously.

Due to these things, I've spent far too much time with myself. I've taken on some dark thoughts. Always thinking about killing myself for real, or even faking my own death. Other things, too. Like brutally torturing the people who have caused me my emotional pain. These thoughts are really starting to scare me.

I just want to look forward to the future of my life, but all of this crap is going to continue to undermine me. I just don't want to feel like this anymore. I look at all of these people around me, talking to their friends and having a great time. It makes me hurt inside, and I want to cry because everyone has left me. Why did I have to be driven into a corner?

I needed to get that off my chest. If you read this, thank you.",depression,t5_2qqqf,My Loneliness and Depression

No i am genuinely interested in peoples thoughts on this, why do you fight it? Is there research to suggest that those you felt less suffering by isolated themselves then felt even less suffering than that after overcoming their social difficulties?

We became good friends after some long middle of the night conversations on facebook, but slowly I started to develop a crush on her that has gotten pretty serious by now. I told her, and although she doesn't feel the same way, she's okay with working on it together and staying good friends. 

I care a lot about her, and since she has shown to be struggling with an abusive childhood I want to do the right thing. List of details I've found so far:
-Father was really abusive, this led to a divorce with her mother. An example of his bahaviour would be putting spiders in her clothes to get her over her fear of spiders. (which needless to say provided quite the opposite result) I don't expect anything sexual. She has not seen him since the divorce, even moved to a diffrent country. This is quite a few years in the past.
-Mother was not really abusive(according to her), but really a tough love kind of person. Focussing a lot on her daughters schoolwork, but forgetting there's more to a kid than school. She missed birthdays and high school graduation. 

She is suffering under this past. problems include, but are not limited to:
-Insomnia
-Nightmares
-Difficulty to process emotions
-Trust issues.
-Very hesitant to almost every form of touch with anybody.
-Not wanting to have children, simply for fearing she might abuse them.
-Very low self esteem.
-Saying about herself that she's a bad person.

I would love to help her in any way shape or form, but I do not know what to do. She herself wants to ignore it, bury it, and is not open to any other options. However, seeing as she is clearly struggling, I would do anything to help her cope. Genuine and honest compliments do not seem to get through to her in any way, and I'm not able to convince her that she's a good person.

The good thing about nightmares is that you know it's not real when you wake up. All you have to discard is adrenaline. But now I have to think about it, and get over whatever the dream was making me feel: anger or resentment or grief, even happiness some days. So that's the first thing that bothers me about dreaming. Sometimes, I would rather just have the nightmares, thanks.

The second thing is that I sleep to *escape* reality, okay? I want nothingness. I want peace. I want a sound-proof, light-proof room. Every time I wake up in the middle of a dream I feel cheated of my rest because I was busy experiencing something in a stupid dream about my dog or whatever and I wake up feeling just as tired as when I fell asleep.

It's all bullshit.

They increased my generic Zoloft from 50 to 100. Do I feel different, three weeks in? Of course not. The medicine is bullshit. I don't know why I am taking it at all.

I didn't go into work today. I don't ever want to go in again, actually, but I don't want to be homeless. I hate my job. I'm single. I just turned 34. Which was very very very hard on me, as a face life as an old maid who will never have children, something I very much wanted for my life.

Now I have to face regaining every one of them because my depression sucks every ounce of desire to eat right and exercise away from me.

I'm a foster parent to a little girl. I love her and she loves me. She's doing really well with me. And yet, I should probably stop foster parenting because I'd really like to come home from work and lay in a bed all evening, and you can't do that as a foster parent.

To be honest, it's a pretty good job. My coworkers are nice, my main supervisor is nice, it pays pretty well and I've got it full time. 


But... Talking on the phone... The company we work for recently made a lot of changes that made almost all of our customers angry. So its pretty much going into work to be screamed at nonstop for 8 hours.


As you can imagine, that is really taking a toll on me. >< It's hard... It's my first job. My parents helped me get it, and they really think that its good. But they're like... ""Well, just deal with it."" How do I deal with it though? It's not that them being angry upsets me in that I think they're angry at me, it's the anger itself that triggers me. I'm not good at dealing with people. When they get mad, I feel like I'm going to be sick or pass out. I don't lose sleep over being called an idiot or anything, but I can't stop myself from feeling terrified of the anger itself. 


It's not only that. Just talking to people, even the nice calls I get, makes me start feeling jittery, and when I realize I made a mistake, I feel like I'm about to have a melt down. I panic... I over think everything, and when I have to ask my supervisor a question about anything, I panic even more and feel horrible and useless. The customers just push me all over and I usually end up giving out credits just to pacify them and end the call. Training didn't prepare me for actually being on the floor AT ALL. I'm not good at this. But it's my first job... I feel like I HAVE to do it. I can't quit so early.... part of me hopes I'll get fired, and the other part is absolutely terrified of the idea.


Over half our class quit on the first day on the production floor. I want to quit or go to part time, but a) my parents won't let me and b) the supervisors say they need the full time workers so they can't give part time. My parents suggested just going part time before I got the job, but when they asked ""This is for full time right?"" I was already panicking and just said ""Oh uh, yeah."" I was too scared and nervous to say ""No, part time."" And now I'm stuck with it. 


It's been about 5 weeks since I(2 weeks training) got the job, and I've been on the floor for 2ish. (I got really sick and ended up home for about a week. Going back to work today...) I'm dreading it. Sitting there, just... Trapped. Since I got the job, I've been more jittery and nervous than before, and just... overall worse. I want to talk to people even less and what little confidence I'd built up is just... going away. All I want to do is curl up in my room and make the awful headaches I get go away. I feel like I'm going to end up having a breakdown in the bathroom or something. I've barely worked here at all so I'm wondering if it will get better or worse with time... I don't feel like being so terrified is justified. >< 


My parents don't believe me since they live by the adage: We have it worse, suck it up buttercup, and admittedly my mom does work at a group home with an awful boss but she doesn't have social anxiety and she's not getting yelled at ALL DAY.


What do I do? How can I manage this? Should I try to convince my parents to let me quit and find another job? What kind of job would even be good? ;_; I don't even know if I even have the courage to ask my parents or talk to them about it... They constantly just shove my problems aside and talk down to me about it. u3u I don't know what to do...",socialanxiety,t5_2r22n,This job is awful and making it worse

I've been dealing with some things in therapy and some of the issues my son is going through came up and how I feel very strongly that I need to put my issues on hold and help him as much as possible. The background of either of our issues isn't important, but the advice the therapist gave me is not only not making sense to me but it makes me feel my therapist is a moron and makes me want to quit seeing them. 

My therapist is encouraging me to engage in self-care when my son is in crisis. She brought up the example of airplane safety and how passengers are told to put on their own oxygen masks before helping their children. This simply doesn't make sense, never has and never will. Adults have greater lung capacity and more dexterity than their children so it is far more likely that they will be able to assist the child and then put their *own* mask on and not the other way around. Not to mention that I'm CERTAIN that if (god forbid) something bad were to happen and my son was injured or hurt or put through a trauma I'm not going to be thinking ""Well, my son isn't doing so good but I'm glad I took the time to breathe and take care of me!"" especially when I know I could have and should have done more to help. This attitude from my therapist is not just illogical to me. Its offensive. I don't deal well when people try to convince me not to take care of my child. Can anyone offer some insight on this? Can you make it make sense to me because I know I need therapy but this kind of stuff just pisses me off and makes me want to quit.

A couple of years ago I met a girl through Yahoo Answers, and we started talking and became friends. Last year I broke my ankle and she started sending me money since my famuly pretty much shunned me for not being rich like they are, and  we ""hooked up"", and she flew over here all the way from the UK. I didn't even want her help but I was broke and she kept insisting. We got married in a lawyer's office a few months after that. The relationship started off badly as she has terrible mood swings and is extremely controlling. She will tell me what to eat, when to eat it, etc.. and if I don't comply she backs off or starts blaming me for everything in her life. She's a vegan extremist (nothing at all against vegans) and her life revolves around veganism and the likes. She doesn't take much care of herself and tries to be a ""hippie"". She yells at me constantly and is just nasty to be around, yet I became emotionally hooked to this person who I cannot even have sex with (last time was like 2 months ago) because she says the we should connect on ""other levels"" and that she doesn't care about it. I don't try to convince her or make any effort in that department. 

Since she came over her I slowly strated going out and overdrinking just to numb myself and avoid dealing with her. I also developed a gambling addiction that scares the living shit out of me. 

Now I think she met some guy and could leave at any moment. I freaked out today and asked her if she would be there when I came back from work and she said she doesn't know. 

If I would be emotionally ok I would have left her a very long time ago, but I'm not. I have OCD, generalised anxiety, and clinical depression that landed me in the hospital a few times due to overdoses, and I'm really frightened that this time around I'll try to end my life for good. I don't know what to do or where to go. If she locks me out of the house, maybe I could stay at an old lady's house in my old neighborhood, but I don't know if that's a good option.

I have joined clubs and do volunteer work to meet people and even tried dating sites, iv set up dates but iv always been stood up or canceled on, I have a guy in my class who is gay and I'm bi and we do get along, he always says that I cared when no one did and he even stayed over one night and it was amazing, he even said he enjoyed it and wanted to do it again yet he won't let me in, he knows id love him and be there yet he pushes me off and fails to see how much he is causing me pain.

My family doesn't even notice, I have tried to end my life by taking sleeping pills but my mum didn't see and said it was just me playing up, my dad (who I no longer see or talk to) told me to get on with it.

I want people to know that just because I'm 18 doesn't mean I don't cry my self to sleep at 4 am because I'm alone, I'm nit even allowed a dog to cuddle or as company, I feel so alone, I have to force myself not to walk into the road, I want people to get that all I want Is a chance to love someone, I'm sick of being stood up and let down and ignored, I have had the love yourself talk and it doesn't work, I do love my self but I'm still alone, my so called consoler didn't care or just did the whole thing about it will blow over, iv been like this since I was 14, iv even cut my self to get some relief but it doesn't work.

Yesterday I failed an Algebra 2 Trig test. I have failed so many tests in my classes this year that I am at the point where I just want to give up on school. I had a bad day and my favorite teacher (Ms W) saw and asked what was wrong. I spilled the beans and said ""I failed a test. I'm failing all my classes."" She looked at me and said that I'd get through it and she'd help me, even though ses not even my teacher anymore. Then today, during my off hour and her planning hour where I usually hang out with her, we sat down and she talked to me. She asked what was wrong and why I was failing. She asked a few questions. She told me she would nag me into doing my work (nicely of course, because she's a nice person) and that she did that becUse she only wants what's best for me. She told me I can get them up, even though I don't believe that myself- she does.

It's always there, never quite goes away. 

That ever-present weight of self-hatred, pushing me further into my self-dug grave.

Every single fucking thing I do just makes me more exhausted. Living is so surprisingly tiring. Not even that I do a while lot that requires a ton of effort. I'm a governess, but it's not terribly difficult. I'm just constantly fatigued, regardless.  

I keep thinking maybe I ought to start cutting again, or just take a lot of weight loss pills and see what that does. Maybe I should DO anything. Anything but just sit here and complain about it to a forum of strangers that really don't give half a damn about me at all. 

If I'm honest I don't care about any of them either. 
No offense, guys. I really don't. I've been burned by redditors before. You all called me ugly and fat and saved pictures of me to be raided by 4chan. 
Which, by the way. That's what started today's bullshit. 

I had found more of those pictures about a week ago. A prospective employer brought it up. He'd googled me and found it. On four or five different sites. Apparently there are more if it's looked up on Yahoo and even more if on an iPhone. 
I digress.
And to top it all off, my ex-fiance contacted me and told me that his life was going really well. 
Cool, and I thought that karma was possibly a thing and the fact that he used to beat the shit out of me and fucked half the town while we were together would make some negative effect on his life. No, just on mine. 

I'm still fat. Still ugly as fuck. Still dumb. And it's impossible for me to find female friends. No women like me. Probably because there's some kind of invisible sign that only men can see, plastered on my forehead saying
""Sack of meat to be used as fleshlight. Enjoy,""

I'm not a whore. I'm not even promiscuous. Sure, I had my days where I wanted to be and the boyfriend I had at the time exacerbated that desire. 
Posting to /r/gonewild was one of the worst mistakes of my life. 

I'm not even sexually active any more. It's like a lead brick has been dropped on my life. Everything is at an abrupt standstill. 
Like a rock stuck on the side of the stream, like Tuck. 

I don't want to live. I don't want to die. I don't have anything to live for. I have no particular reason to want to commit suicide. I can't seem to decide. 

I've been on the brink of indecision since I was 14. I'm almost 22. My birthday is on the 27th. 
Granted, that's not a terribly long time to be indecisive. At the same time though...

Anyone that's read at this point must be bored out of their wits. For that I apologize heartily. Here's a [video](http://youtu.be/vftIGU8-uqs?list=LLfahpIWFwQoIpPu0BE-OtWQ) of something that may entertain you mildly. 

More rabbit-trailing. 

I have this friend. He's been quite fond of me for some time, and I like him too...I think he doesn't quite understand how little I trust when he says he cares. 
You understand, I've been told this by person after person and they all leave one way or another. Nobody ever sticks around. 

Maybe it's a personality flaw. I may be too negative. 

I'm an overachiever too. Disgustingly so. I try my hardest to win approval. I almost make myself sick. 
I cook, clean, play three or four instruments, know bits and pieces of three other languages besides English, can cultivate a relatively intelligent conversation without entirely murdering it or putting a person to sleep; I'm relatively internet savvy and can fix nearly anything. I crochet and sew and am decent with makeup and hair. I paint and sketch and have read book after e-book regarding tips on how to perform perfect fellatio. 

I'm supposedly every man's dream woman. 

Yet nobody wants me. 
Even this guy that says he likes me, when we're around each other he doesn't behave as if he's even remotely interested. I can't possibly trust his ""I love you""s (hastily spoken as an afterthought or not even spoken at all in my presence. Only when we're separated by miles and miles does he become remotely romantic at all).

My mum doesn't talk to me unless it's to ask if I've made any associates for the latest pyramid scheme she's being tricked by. 

My dad couldn't care less about me. 
My brothers are in prison for the umpteenth time and living with some random girlfriend likely making a third niece or nephew that I'll never be able to visit once he's done with the mother. 

Am I a sociopath? 

Am I just unloveable?

I'm not even really looking for advice here, which I'm almost certain I wouldn't get even if I were looking for it. 

I suppose I'm just wanting to get all this off my chest. 

There's not really anyone else for someone like me to turn to. 

Which is really sad, considering this is a website full of self-righteous cynical a-holes. 

Proof? Visit /r/rateme every now and then. The ratings alone are enough to break a girl's heart. 

Next time you look at a random girl, don't just judge her based on appearance. For all you know she's standing on the precipice of suicide and just needs one more little tiny reason.

I would greatly appreciate any advice. I am probably worrying over nothing, as I do tend to worry obsessively over little things. I recently got a new psychiatrist 6 months ago (I had to stop seeing my previous one because she only sees students on the college campus. And since I graduated from college, I'm not a student anymore). I am on several medications for depression, anxiety, and BPD.

I've been having a difficult time keeping appointments with this new psychiatrist because the appointments are in the morning, and I take medication at night that helps me sleep, and sometimes I turn off my alarm in the morning while I'm still asleep. I have already missed 2 appointments in the past 6 months. I feel really bad about this, and I know it is my fault. 

Last week on Tuesday I was having a very rough time with suicidal thoughts. I tied a belt around my neck and was going to hang myself. But I ended up going to the emergency room to get help instead. I was too scared of the physical pain of dying. In the emergency room, they gave me a prescription for a very heavy dose of anti-anxiety medication and they sent me home. They told me to follow up with my psychiatrist as soon as I can. I left the emergency room at about 3am in the morning. I went to the 24/7 pharmacy near my house right afterwards and filled the prescription. The prescription bottle said to take the medication at night. The next afternoon, I called my psychiatrist to make an appointment as soon as possible. She said that the next availability she had was the following day at 11am. 

I took the anti-anxiety pill that night, and set my alarm for 9am the next morning so that I could go to my psychiatrist's appointment. The next morning at 11:30am I woke up. I had missed my appointment. I don't even remember turning off my alarm. I feel really bad because this is the 3rd appointment I missed. It was 100% my fault, I know. I called the psychiatrist's office. The front desk lady told me that since I have missed 3 appointments, my chart is closed and the only one who can open it back up is the Office Manager.The Office Manager will be back in the office tomorrow. I have left her a message explaining the situation, and I plan on also calling her to speak directly with her.

I am very worried. It has been almost a week since my ER visit, I haven't followed up with a psychiatrist like the doctor at the ER told me to. I made an appointment with my general doctor and he called another psychiatrist to make an appointment with me, but that appointment is in 2 months. I just feel very worried about this situation. I messed up by missing my appointment, and it's my fault. I really hope that I haven't been fired by my psychiatrist. 2 months is a long time to wait to see a new one. I am very worried and am angry with myself. I just needed to vent. Thank you.

I've had depression since i was about 13 ish so about 8 years now. However i have only recently been diagnosed and began seeking treatment the other years i just went on and i thought i was supposed to feel that way.
My mom is understanding and wants to help me, but my dad just tells me to man up and suck it up, i have never really had a good relationship with him. I pretty much feel dead inside, i dont feel anything. The past few months had gone by ok and i was meh going along fighting onward however these past 2 weeks have been very ruff i just feel like i don't matter. I don't care about anything, hell i don't even have my license yet and tbh i don't really have any drive to get one, i don't have drive to do anything. I just sit here and browse Reddit/play games in my free time because it occupies my brain from my troubles but i do know this is only a temporary solution. I didnt really go through a bad child hood, always had the necessities and my parents took care of me so idk why i feel so depressed. Sometimes i think maybe im just a shitty person. I think these past 2 weeks have been due to this girl that just started at my job, shes only 3 years younger than i am. And well she just hit me the right way i like her style, but she has a boyfriend, however even beside that fact shes made me realize even more that im alone. I dont have anyone to turn to,talk to, look forward to seeing, i dont like to tell my mom because she has enough stuff to worry about being the bread winner so i dont wanna worry her more. Due to my depression i have lost contact with alot of friends from highschool and even with the ones i do still talk to  i dont have anyone close i can talk personally with.
Im pretty sure i didnt organize this very well so im sorry for that, thank you guys for reading my little rant.",depression,t5_2qqqf,I feel pretty much dead inside.

This book has been immensely helpful to me in not only confronting my abuser but in understanding how my emotional status is affected by my relationship with my abuser. I hope that anyone who suffers from abusive relationships, whether you're in one or witnessing one, can benefit the same way I did.

To give a super brief summary of my issues. I grew up in a household with alcoholic parents. My father was physically abusive towards my mother and my mother was verbally abusive. I grew up in fear of living in my house but I was too scared and depressed to do anything about it. I tried committing suicide three times in my senior year of high school and freshmen year of college. Now I'm seeking help in getting over my looming depression and hoping to get over this for life. My father has rebuked his abusive ways and tries every day to get better and he absolutely has. However, my mother suffers from projective personality disorder which means that she is psychologically unable to recognize her abusive ways and simply pawns off her qualities onto others.

I've had huge issues with my depression coming and going as it pleases and my counselor linked it to my developing brain dredging up the old abusive memories. So I picked up this book at my counselor's recommendation and it has helped immensely.

Basic outline:
-Abuser's mentality: This can help the reader view things from the perspective of the abuser and understand how to guard against such thoughts.
-Victim's mentality: This describes how victims might feel, and gives guidelines to identify whether or not you might be one (some victims of abusive relationships live in denial).
-Testimonies of people who successfully stood up against their abuser. 
-Bullying

Feel free to ask me any questions about my situation or the text in general. I legitimately hope that someone can benefit from this in the same way I have.",depression,t5_2qqqf,"I have a resource for anyone who is in, or has suffered from, an abusive relationship. This includes spouses, SO's, children of abusive parents, victims of bullying, or even just friendships."

Maybe I need a slap to the face, a reality check. Then again, when you've been homeless for five years straight, how much worse could it really get? 

At least I'm not a sex slave. 

Who am I kidding at least at that point I would have something to say about my life. I would most likely be fed. I would most likely have a bed to sleep in, even if I'm tied to it. 

I want to just not give a shit about anything but who am I kidding I care too much. That's why I've done the stupid insane shit I've done just to try and keep from sleeping in a ditch. Which I'll end up doing again anyway the way things are looking.

She is the only shoulder I've ever had to cry on, and the only person I've ever really been able to always confide in. I have trust issues due to a lot of really bad relationships and losing two of my friends to suicide - I just really don't know who is going to stick around anymore. However, she always has. Whenever I've been at my absolute worst in life, she has always been there to help pick me up. Back in the days of highschool, when I was still living with my parents, when fights would break out in the family, she would ALWAYS show up just to help me escape from the situation.

Last year, right before the end of the college semester, things got horribly rough. On a bad night, she came into my room with a friend to carry me to the car and into the ER, and comforted me through the process of being admitted to the behavioral medicine inpatient ward, and she was the first to come and visit.

My parents aren't around anymore, and I don't have family, and while I have other friends, there is just such a level of understanding that is missing, as well as trust that I'm not ready to give.

I just don't know what to do. I was just told by my therapist a couple weeks ago that I made such drastic improvements that I don't have to come to therapy anymore, but I still feel as if I'm falling back into that hole. I'm so scared that I'm going to end up in the hospital again and screw up college again because of it. I would feel like a failure if I wasn't able to complete a semester of college.

And that they suffer from “loss of pleasure in any previously pleasurable activity”. This is why people don’t understand depression and get frustrated with it and stigmatize it. 

Depression isn’t simply the presence of sadness, in my opinion. Rather, it high lights all the pleasurable aspects of life and constantly reminds you how incapable you are of appreciating them. 

Depression dangles happiness in front of you and then reminds you that you’ll never reach it, given your own fucked up head. It makes you hate yourself for not being able to enjoy all there is to enjoy anymore. I don’t only hate myself, but I hate myself for everyone around me. What if I had to put up with what I put them through? I’d be stressed, worried, and brought down. I stress people out, worry them, and bring them down. And this realization, in turn, brings me down further. How far down can I go?

I love looking at pictures of crazy nature because I put myself there in my head. I can’t hurt anyone anymore and everyone can move on and I can breathe. But I’m not fucking stupid. I know if I left, it would destroy everyones lives. Which means, either way, I’m a burden.

I've never been in one. Closest was this three year longish, on and off, mutual monogamous FWB with guy (who is my best friend) that I really, really liked and I hoped had feelings for me. This July he basically said that he cared about me deeply as a friend, but we would only be friends. Which was a blow, partly because I liked him but more so because I've had enough bad happen in the last 36+ months that I desperately wanted ONE good thing in my life to go my way. And it didn't. And it hurt. It still kinda hurts, but I recognize our relationship is better because the pressure is off me to be perfect all the time or wonder if he would like someone else or whatever.

I don't have a ton of experience with, but most of it- barring two with two people, most of it has been lackluster or painful. One of which was best friend. I figured it was good because we had been really close before we started fooling around (and that probably accounts for part of it) and most of the other people I didnt have as strong of a connection with. Which is frustrating because I don't think most people are willing to wait two years, and I-when its good- tend to like sex.

So flash forward to last week. I met this guy that I had kinda known by face (and I had thought was cute for a long time) and he was hanging out at with me and my really good friend while we were out and then eventually back at my house. He ended up staying over, and I wasn't intending on sex stuff buttttt it happened. And the best sex of my life, bar none. He came by earlier this week again and it was good for him, but we discovered that I still have issues with penetration. I'm pretty sure its vaginismus stemming from an assault two years ago because I could be fingered before then. After then, that and penetration are painful/I can't do it which I chalked up to anxiety/inexperience/unease. Which is frustrating because I LIKE SEX DAMMIT. I want to be able to have sex with a partner I like and not be worried about having to explain 'yeah by the way, this will hurt like a motherfucker'. I'm planning on talking to someone when I can get in but its discouraging to me. 

Anyways. Guy I like and me were talking to today and he doesn't want to  screw around anymore because of residual crap with his ex (who incidentally, I knew better then I knew him. I didn't see him around as much which is why we never talked but I was friendly with the ex). Which I get and support. And I honestly am probably not in the best boat to be trying for something because I know I have a lot on my plate and I think I'm super woman and can take on everything.... and a lot of the time it hits me in the face rather violently that I can't. So rationally I do get it.

Emotionally, I'm upset because I genuinely do like this kid and I've never felt like this this quickly with someone. And it kind of freaks me out because I don't understand it and I don't have the experience to back it up. And the experience I do have ends bad for me. and I know it's probably not me, but yay lots of insecurities cropping up tonight about how I'm not good enough and this is why people run the fuck away from people like me and I'm being dumb. 

He still wants to be my friend which is cool because I have had fun hanging out with him, and we get a long well. and I don't have a ton of friends (hence, venting to reddit rather then an IRL friend). And I dunno. I just like him. Maybe someday things will work out, but its better for me to say that they won't rather then sit in false hope. 
And I have a test tomorrow over three chapters and NOTHING is retaining. My teacher doesn't give study guides so I'm trying to memorize a lot of material and kind of freaking that it's not happening. So that's awesome. 

Also it will be two years since assault on the 28th, and I for some reason that I don't know thought it would be a good idea to look up the asshole and saw a) his picture and b) he is STILL employed by the university. who knows what he did. And didn't do much besides tell his supervisor. So doubly awesome.

Idk. I'm just rambling at this point.

The tl;dr- I can't relationship, I liked a guy and kinda got friendzoned and rejection sucks and I am woefully unprepared for a test tomorrow. But I have pumpkin beer. Woo.",depression,t5_2qqqf,"Just venting about personal stuff :( I need an ear (this is long, I'm sorry) slightly nsfwish"

So, I have a few scars from self-inflicted injury half way up my left forearm, on the inside fleshy bit sort of in-line with my thumb.

Only scar one is noticeable, another is quite faint, and to be honest I couldn't even tell you where any of the others are without a very strong light.

So this main scar is about two inches long, only slightly wider than the blade of a knife, pink-coloured, and I f*cking hate looking at it.

Would getting a tattoo conceal it or just draw more attention to the area? Anyone else had this sort of tattoo before?

I'm not sure what I'd get a tattoo of. I guess it would have to somehow use the line of the scar in its design.

I feel like I'm going to die one way or another.I have emotional/mental maladies: anxiety (that became huge), OCD (that goes along with the anxiety), and depression, which can turn clinical.

This is all comes down to my wife, or better yet me having hooked up with my wife out of loneliness and stupidity. She's a major manipulator, probably has bigger mental problems than I do, and is truly insane. Every day she yells at me and starts huge problems out of nothing - constantly insulting me and trating me like shit. I do not want to play the victim - something she accusses me of - but it's the reality right now. She came over from the UK about a year ago and we got married 5 months ago, approximately. We met online. She's an extreme vegan who lives in her own fantasy world and I fear that she wants to destroy me in every level for her own sadistic purposes.

I would never ever hurt her, but she's emailing everybody she knows, defaming me and telling me that I'm this and I'm that - she accuses me of emotional abuse - something she made up. I NEVER raise my voice at her or treat her badly in any way. All I do is come back home late from work because I cannot stand to be around her and her fits. Since he came over I started drinking and gambling (the latter completely stopped for a while already, and the former has been reduced to a couple of drinks a day, but I haven't been drunk in a while, just buzzed).

She asked me for a divorce the other day. I told her that where I live it takes time to process one, as she wants to return to the UK as soon as possible, and had another huge fit last night, insulting me in every imaginable way and saying that my funks are just me playing the victim, that my job (which I do very well) already had a lot of patience with me (had an issue here the other day which is now resolved). She's a real emotional abuser, threatens me, etc.. to not mention the demonic fit she had a few days ago when she started yelling and banging the walls like crazy. I was scared shitless.

When I started writing this my heart was racing like crazy and felt pressure in my chest. 

Now it stopped, but I don't know what to do now. I fear it will start again, and I fear not making it through the day at work. I have to meet the consul of an EU country so I can get said country's passport (I'm already a citizen) and leave where I'm living now, so I can get proper care and therapy for what I have. I cannot continue living with this woman, but where I live, a woman has much more rights than a man. If I leave the house I would be abandoning the home, and she could really screw me over in a divorce. What I do know is that she wants to go back ""home"" (the UK) now. She's originally from Spain. She wants to go really soon and is upset over the fact that the divorce process here lasts a few months. 

I just called the old lady that took care of me when I had a broken ankle last year. She told me to go to the ER. I cannot give in. Must work through the day, and prevail somehow. Yet I don't know if I can. however, the heart racing stopped, and the dizziness subsided somewhat, if not I would not be able to write this. Yet I fear this happening again.

I tried to slit my writsts twice and now all of my thoughts are on tying a nooze and hanging myself from somewhere. I feel like I have no way out. Any advice, if you're willing to give it, would be welcome. Please don't be patronising or mock me over this. I already posted on /r/relationships and /r/relationship_advice and they just mocked me.

I've always been a very strong person, healthy, independent, outgoing, etc. Then, I met someone who is now my ex. I didn't even like him in the beginning, he fell for me, he kept trying and trying, until I finally fell for him. I pushed him to get a job he really wanted, gave him a lot of emotional support, until he succeeded. As soon as he quickly got promoted, and now gets paid **very well**, and is pretty much on top. As soon as he got there... he disappears on me. After a couple of weeks of not knowing anything about him, he finally calls me to tell me we are no longer boyfriends.

Even after all of this, I never had the courage to block him. He'd constantly call me when he was down, and when I'd cheer him up, he'd start bragging about how much money he makes now, how much he travels, how successful he now is. Little by little, it kept sucking out positivity I had. It almost feels like he feeds off my depression, like it boosts his self esteem by seeing how easily he can bring me down. Last week, I found out he has had two relationships already, and how happy he was with them. That... that completely broke my heart, my soul, my mind. I'm not the person I used to be.

I took about 96 sleeping pills with a lot of alcohol. I vomited them, my stomach couldn't hold them in. Then I tried again, same story. This time though, I was suffocating while vomiting, and my roommate heard it. I was so drunk, desperate and careless, I didn't even check if I was home alone. He called my mom and told her. She instantly flew over night, and surprised me with a visit. I love her so much... But this wasn't a cry for attention. In fact, while I was thankful and happy to see her, I was upset that she spent a lot of money on visiting me. My father constantly calls me to check up on me. My whole family loves me very much, I have a lot of friends, and I have a pretty good social life. I have more emotional support from everyone than I could ask for. I'm very lucky.

With all of that said, the ex broke me down so much, that all of that doesn't matter. I understand the pain I'd cause them if I had succeeded, but I'm not willing to live just to keep them happy. Every single morning, first thought that comes to mind is ""I wish I was dead"". I spend hours researching how to do it painlessly, what building I can go to, is there a hotel where I can actually open the window all the way up, and many other options. I unfortunately have not found the one for me just yet. Throughout the day, even when I'm happy, even while I'm at a party, at the bar, hanging out with friends, playing video games, etc.. I'm **still* thinking how I want to die. I've been like this for almost a year, except last week, I finally tried it.

I know I'll try it again, once I decide how to do it next.

Oh, and I forgot to mention. I've called a handful of the suicide hotlines. Wow... how do these people get hired? unless they're volunteers, but still. They just say the name of the hotline, and they just stay quiet, not even a simple ""hello"". I have no use for them now, but in the beginning of this ordeal, I did call them. Now, I really don't need them.

I'm making this post as I slowly cry myself to sleep. Anyways, so recently I've been losing friends, not in a physical sense, but in an emotionally detached way. The person I talk to about myself was probably the closest friend I had. I stopped talking to her due to a… well, let's call it an argument. She has dumb feelings for me, I don't like her back and she gets jealous because I hang around this girl I like a lot. I actually don't like her all that much anymore anyways and the only reasons I talk to her are a couple of psychological situations.

For one, I have an obsession with my ex, who broke up with me nearly a year ago, and this girl has a few qualities similar enough to my ex to have my attention. I know she may read this, and I don't particularly care if any of this hurts her feelings right now. The second reason I bother to talk to her is that I have no one else. l'm writing this for the same reason. I can't turn anywhere else.

I feel like a nobody. A single entity unbeknownst to the world; alone with no clear purpose. We were all born to die. I feel like an empty shell of my former self. A being with no heart, Ieft hanging out in the open. I am nobody to anybody. All I feel is a deep existential depression. I just can't live like this.

""In the beginning the Universe was created. This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move."" -Douglas Adams.

I'm taking a Computer Science course that I might fail. To put this in context, I'm an English major, and at a certain point I started realizing that I didn't have much of a plan for the future. I was reasonably good at an intro comp sci course, so I thought I might pursue a minor. Long story short, there was a project that brought my grade down. My professor is optimistic, because my other work has been pretty good, but the current project is still kicking my ass and there's a possibility it could send my grade over the tipping point. My GPA could take the hit, but it's obviously not desirable.

Anyway, the possibility of failure hinging almost entirely on a lone assignment would usually drive me insane, but I feel like the sensations of academic anxiety that I used to dread have become indistinguishable from my day-to-day dread.

I know and accept that I have clinical depression, and I've been where you've all been, have been suicidal and struggled a lot, and I've gotten to a point in few months back of wanting to get better and seeing a counselor, who sent me to a Dr (a psychiatrist), who changed me from Ambien (Zolpidem Tartarate) to Remeron (Mirtazapine). 

I am also taking Lexapro. I have been feeling so tired ever since I have been on these medicines in the mornings when I wake up. I used to wake up every day and go running (for years, was runner in school and college, i ran for D1), and I have been feeling very bad and guilty on days when I don't go running. I used to wake up early (6-ish), and lately, I struggle so much to get up from my bed :(. I can't go running, and I don't have any heart to. it's completely unlike me. I've told my dr. about this, and she has changed me from Trazadone to Ambien to Lexapro to now Remeron, and I still feel bad and I don't have any more faith in my medicines. She's not sure if its due to my depression or due to medicines and I am also not sure. At-least I used to run before, and would feel good for couple of hours or most of the day until evening comes. My evenings are the worst times for me and when I feel most depressed.

I am here to check if there's anyone taking Remeron, and if you;ve been seeing any changes in your moods?

I'm looking for some practical advice regarding how you deal with your mental health issues impacting your job performance and how you manage your money. Long post, but bear with me.

I graduated college last June with a degree in history. I was a 4.0 student for most of my college career, but after going through a horrible breakup my academic performance tanked in my last half-year and I finished with a cumulative GPA of about a 3.4, which is not very competitive. 

I planned on returning to grad school one day to get my doctorate, but only if I can get into a decent program, since I don't want to rack up even more student loan debt without a prestigious alma mater that increases my likelihood of getting a teaching job at the university level. If I can't get into a decent program I'll have to make do without a higher degree. I always thought I would get into a great program because for most of college I excelled very much, but after how badly I fucked up in my last two quarters, this path may be closed to me now, and I may be stuck at a shitty income level like my current one.

Presently I have two part time jobs where I'm scheduled from 36-44 hours a week. I make $11.70 and I live in northern California so rent and the cost of living is pretty expensive. When I manage to show up to work every day, I make about $700-800 a paycheck or 1400-1600 a month. I don't see many opportunities for a better paying job right now, but this level of income is manageable.

The problem is that my depression is destroying my motivation so badly that I usually call in sick 2-3 times in a 2 week pay period. That's a loss of (on average) $150 a paycheck. Quite a lot. I have a chronic illness, so I can blame it on that, but I feel like a piece of shit for lying. I try to compensate mentally by reminding myself than when I DO show up to work, I'm always praised for working very hard, and my managers are kind people who don't berate me for when I miss work.

Of course, I don't think depression is any less of a real, debilitating illness than my physical health problems, but I hate lying, and I don't feel like it's socially acceptable to say to my boss ""I couldn't get out of bed because I just wanted to die,"" you know? So I feel guilty for both my attendance problems and for lying, and this decreases my likelihood of promotions or pay raises, further compounding the situation.

Also, I feel my depression fucks up my ability to manage money. For one thing, I don't have the energy to make actual grocery shopping trips, so I eat out at fast food joints a lot and waste a lot of money in that regard. And spending money on shit like makeup and clothes gives me a temporary boost in my mood, but it's only a transient and unhealthy ""fix"" like booze or drugs, to my mind.

So for those of you with similar problems, how do you manage it? Have you ever been honest with an employer about your mental health? How do you deal with feelings of guilt for attendance problems or, better yet, how do you make yourself get the fuck out of bed in the morning? And how do you make yourself budget your money more intelligently when you have very little energy or ability to give a shit about your long term future?",depression,t5_2qqqf,how to deal with depression impacting your work performance and money management? practical advice wanted.

I watched her take her last breath. I've only had one other grandparent die and I was not very close with him (didn't even meet him till I was 12 or so) so it was not as difficult. The worst part was seeing my mom and aunt and grandmother so upset. Now my grandmother is gone and I just loved her so much. She was very special to me.

She suffered her whole life with severe depression. She's been through so much: a few suicide attempts and numerous hospitalizations... She even got ECT done back in the 60s and she told me all they did was strap her down and make her bite down on a board. She also had a stroke, a heart attack, and she even literally broke her neck. And she survived all of that. Every time, the doctors said she'll never make it out of the hospital, but she always did. Until today. She was so strong, but she just couldn't hold on any longer. 


They found a mass on her pancreas just about a month ago when she was getting treated for pneumonia. The doctor said there was a 99% chance it was cancer, but she didn't want a biopsy because if it was cancer and they told her how long she has, then she'd just be waiting around to die.

Then on Monday this week, she was admitted to the hospital for pneumonia again. She had aspirated her own vomit. They diagnosed her with the most advanced stage of sepsis. She was in respiratory distress also so they put her on a ventilator. When she woke up she tried to pull the ventilator out so they had to put these huge white mitts on her hands so she couldn't pull it out. My first visit with her, she looked so unhappy. She couldn't talk, couldn't use her hands. She would just bang the mitts together over and over and over very slowly, trying to get us to take them off of her.

Then they took the ventilator out yesterday because she was getting better. She started to go downhill again within hours but she didn't want the ventilator again. She wanted to die. So we stood around her, holding her hands, stroking her hair, giving her kisses and crying, while she gasped for breath with an oxygen mask on. Then they took the mask off today while I was at home resting and apparently she was talking a little. I missed it. She mouthed the words ""I love you too"" to me several times when she had the oxygen mask on, but I wish I could have heard her say it. By the time I got there, she couldn't talk anymore.

After a few hours, she took her last breath. I held her hand until it was ice cold. I couldn't let go. My aunt actually got into the bed with her and held her and sung to her as she passed away. It was a heartbreaking scene.

This is my first experience losing someone close to me. And I'm in one of the worst depressive episodes I've ever had. I just don't understand how I'm supposed to move on from this. It hurts so much. I feel like half of my heart is missing.

And having everyone around me being so sad is so incredibly painful. I don't know how I'm going to get through this. The only peace I have is that she is no longer suffering. I feel like that should be enough and I feel so selfish for making this about myself.

All of the self loathing came bubbling to the top again today. It's been months, but for a half hour it came back full force.

The funny thing is that I actually felt okay this morning. I felt... chipper? And then my workday went to shit and I started making careless mistakes and I kept cursing at myself. In six hours I have to do it all over again. What's the point? I give all of this time away to a company that doesn't even care about me for 150 bucks a week?

Why should I keep doing this? it's making me miserable.

What else makes me miserable? Toning down my agony so I don't scare other people. It's gotten to the point where I'm scaring myself, though, so if this gets me committed, it gets me committed. Who winds up paying for mental hospital stays, by the way? I'd rather die than bankrupt my parents. Here's my confession. Here are all the things I've played down and lied about when my therapists have asked about it, partially because I'm afraid of being even more of a burden and partially because I'm afraid they'll decide that I'm broken beyond repair. The things that I try to ignore in the hope that they'll go away.

Sometimes I want to break things. Sometimes I have fantasies about hurting other people, mainly customers. The recoil is strong and immediate. The desire to cause others pain is perverse, and it makes me sick to my stomach when I realize what I'm doing. I'm terrified that one day I'll snap and I won't be able to pull myself back and I don't know what might happen if I lose control.

I think about death a lot more frequently than I admit to anyone. I don't want to exist. It's painful. I'm suicidal a lot, but again, I push it to the background and hope it goes away on its own. In the winter, sometimes I take walks outside and think about how easy it would be to just let myself succumb to hypothermia.

I hate myself. I really do. There's not much I'm proud of. Never had a girlfriend, feel unworthy of love. I'm fat, I'm lazy, I'm not mentally well. I'm a liar, I'm a parasite, I'm a fake.

I can't deal with these things and work at the same time. I want to hole up in my room forever. I want to sleep for a long time. Right now, I want to die.",depression,t5_2qqqf,"It's been months, but here I am again."

As mentioned before, I have OCD, generalised anxiety disorder and depression which can turn clinical, and I've had these problems since i was a child. 

I'll say the backstory again:

I met my wife through where else but Yahoo Answers - we were ""friends"" back then - she's 26 years-old, from Spain, and was dating a 65-year-old man. She spoke vile things about him to me and to many others then. She left him and moved in with a 60-year-old man. The same thing happened. I mention the age due to the difference and her possible promiscuity, but know that age doesn't always matter.

Last year i suffered a broken ankle, and since my family did not help, as they're very wealthy and see me like a burden (even with my brother and sister telling me to go kill myself, and I'm not joking) - she sent me funds from the UK which I accepted only after she insisted many times. Then I became bait. One day she suddenly buys her ticket to where I live, and we move in together. Every day she wrote me very long emails saying how she wants to be with me for eternity, etc.. I knew that she had a pretty extreme way of thinking, as she's pretty much a militant vegan, believes that she'll live to be at least 200, and is not human, but from an extraterrestrial species - no joke. I did not know that she was being very serious about these last two points, and she seemed pretty sane when she said that. 

I was very emotionally vulnerable back then and accepted her coming over here. Then hell ensued. She would throw a tantrum every other day, tried to control me in every way she could. I could not get a haircut. I could only wear shorts, sandals, and a t-shirt. I had to eat exactly what she ate, etc.. I could not call my friends from within the house because she would hear everything.

The situation got so bad that I started drinking heavily and gambling, and I'm not addicted to either. The latter I stopped completely, but I still have a couple of whiskeys or beers now and then just to forget. 

Anyway, this girl is clearly not emotionally/mentally stable in any sense. The foul things she tells me are horrible. I've never been told that ""your family had to stand you all your life - poor them"" or ""I can't  believe how your job put up with you for so many years"". These words hurt horribly and despite this, I still love her (or I think I do) and now she wants to file for divorce, as I didn't change the way she wanted me to in 1 year. We've been married for about 5 months. I feel guilty. I started smoking more, drinking more, etc.. because she was making me lose my mind. Or because I let her make me lose my mind. 

She had huge tantrums - one in particular - where she started banging the walls and screaming like she was possessed after I told her - peacefully - that I felt like ending myself. That this is too much. Everybody advised me to call the police. I did not.  

Now she's abroad and extended her trip until the 6th. She claims to be asexual, and I know asexual people - I went through an asexual phase myself - and she's anything but that. She's probably getting laid by somebody else and this thought rips me to pieces, because if there was one good thing in our relationship it was sex once a month or once every two months. That's when one feels closer to the partner, and it's horrible to think this.

Right now, she's probably fucking some guy on her trip and writing vile things about me to everybody. I never ever did anything wrong to her - my conscience is clear. On the other hand, she destroyed me, yet I still have feelings for this person. I feel used and trampled on, and the thought of her writing to a whole bunch of people - maybe even my more normal family members - made me literally vomit. 

I have a history of overdosing and once I almost jumped off a building. Now that I have the apartment to myself i feel like tying this nuzzle to the roof and just ending it, but I cannot pull through the act. I married her to rebuild my trust in people, as I've been used over and over again. I thought it would be different this time around. People let me down constantly, and I'm scared shitless of hurting myself beacuse It's been 35 years of hell.

Any advice would be welcome, and no, I am not trying to play the victim. I'm on medication but don't have time to see a therapy due to all of the working hours.

So basically I have been dating this wonderful girl for 2 years. She is sweet, kind and basically everything I have ever wanted and needed in a girl. The issue is though she has a lot of demons and it caught up to are relationship. She was rapped for two years when she was 4 by a man who is still not in prison. You can say since I found out everything and i mean its stuff I never thought people could actually do I have been very very protective of her. Last month the guy came up to her and said are you still with that guy which she replied yes. Then he said youll never be a good mother, your to damaged, you cant be fixed. He then pulled out video tapes and said I watch these 2 days a week. It was videos of what the guy did to her. It caused a lot of issues in our relationship and it made her break up with me because she wants to figure herself out. I didnt have any contact with her even though I wanted it so badly until last night when she called me crying because she had bad dreams about the guy and needed to talk to me. I talked to her said good nice things to calm her down then she went to bed.

I have been trying to get her to see someone. I have tried to convince her to report the guy but she defends him saying he was more of a father to me then anyone else. It sounds like stockholm syndrome to me but im not sure. People on the relationship advice say I need to let her go but its really hard too. I was planning on marrying her one day soon so obviously if I have to let her go I want it to be done right. I just want to help her get through this but I dont know what to do. I have not told anyone about this but I am so lost. I want to marry her, be with her, but I feel like first I want to be able to get her the help she needs.

I think she started to get frustrated and even walked up and threw herself into my arms at lunch in front of all my friends (to this day this the only time Ive ever hugged a girl and it wasn't even me who initiated).

Well, I sent in a request at least and I'm waiting to get a reply. I've had recurring depressions for as long as I can remember. For a few months at the time I will feel down, tired, unable to make myself do things I need to do, quick to anger and tears. I'll sleep for 12 hours and just want to continue sleeping when I wake up. Or I won't be able to sleep at all. Sometimes I eat nothing, and other times I eat everything in sight and hate myself for it. Then I will feel kind of normal, not overly happy or anything but kind of ""flat"" if you get what I mean, for 3-4 weeks before it starts over again. 

Now I've just entered a low phase again, starting sometime this past month. It's the worst one I can remember having. I can't even pretend to be happy or normal around people anymore, when I fake a smile or laugh it sounds and looks faked and I immediately go back to looking sad. People are concerned for me and I lie and tell them I'm fine. I can't make myself cook or clean or go to work, and today I even pretended I wasn't home when my nan and grandad came to visit me. I cry all the time, over tiny things. My long distance boyfriend has been extra sweet with me lately and every time he compliments me I start crying. We even booked a holiday together for next spring so I should be happy and excited but I just feel dull, boring, tired and weepy. I'm getting to the point of considering suicide.

So I told my boyfriend all this today and while I was talking to him I wrote everything down in my local health centre's appointment web form. And I just sent it in. I still don't quite believe I've just done that. I'm terrified, I'm gonna have to talk about all these personal things with a stranger. I'm freaking out inside. 

**TL;DR** Been depressed on and off all my life, recently got in the worst episode I can remember.

I too suffer from anxiety and depression and we are both seeing counselors for it. I have recently been put on medication for it and it is working wonders. My boyfriend is also working on being medicated but hasn't been able to get an appointment yet. 

The thing is, even though I know what it feels like to have depression and anxiety, we are two completely different people. What helps for me does not help for him. I feel like when I try to help it just makes it all so much worse and when I just try to let him be, I feel guilty for not doing more. 

I am so frustrated lately because it seems like he just keeps screwing himself over. I know its not his fault. At all. But I don't know how to help him when it seems like he won't help himself. Yes, he is going to see a counselor but yet he is still skipping his college classes and putting off his homework which just makes him feel so much worse. If he fails this semester he will lose his financial aid which he absolutely cannot afford to do. I have helped him out financially in the past but I cannot keep doing that because I am just a college student too. 

It is so hard knowing that I am doing so much better and I can't help him get better too.

I literally am tired of everything, I'm physically and emotionally exhausted, I'm more and more irritable every day and it's been growing steadily worse. We had a pizza day at work and the entire time as people were yammering on about this and that I just wanted to punch them all in the throat so they would shut up or go back to my office, lock the door and sit under the desk but I couldn't do either of those because the former is ""a bad thing"" and the latter is frowned up because I wouldn't be participating in office kumbaya bullshit and that is also apparently ""a bad thing"".


Dealing with this house I bought has been an exercise in frustration; The previous owners basically masked a bunch of things that started cropping up shortly after I moved in and then it got progressively worse from there with the roof leaking / destroying some of my ceilings and walls and the condo board refusing to do anything for over a year being a pretty huge milestone. Then pretty much doing a quick patch job and slapping everyone with an extra $150 a month for 4 years because they don't have enough money to do any real repairs due to overspending.

I've had ads to rent out one of my bedrooms because with this extra money being taken and other bills from work I've put in to try and make the place better I just can't keep up.  I genuinely don't want to have to deal with living with someone, in fact I wish I could just quit work, lock my doors, put in a slot for food/grocery deliveries and never leave the house again (as it slowly crumbles around me) but at this point I have no real choice in the matter. That's been a frustrating experience as well

Here's how it pretty much goes every time;

""Hi, I'm interested can I come see the place?""

""Sure thing here's all the info you need to get here.""

Visit happens

""Ok, I'm checking out a few other places today but I'll get back to you in a bit""

""Sure thing""

Later that day or next day ""Ok, I want in, when can i drop off first and last?""

""Well before we get to that can you fill out this background check form and give me a proof of employment and then we can sit down a sign a lease.""

**We're sorry, the person you have just responded to no longer exists...**

I've cut out all contact with family over the past year and a half, slowly doing the same with what little ""friends"" I had. except for the asshole who owes me money, cutting contact with him would just make him happy... no him I want to strap him down, cut his balls off, maybe snip the tendons in his hands too and then toss him out of a truck in a back road somewhere, preferably somewhere that has irate bears with irritable bowel syndrome but again that would be ""a bad thing"" 

I've snapped at the cat multiple times and considered just leaving the doors open and letting her leave on more than one occasion though even I know all she wants is for me to spend some time with her.

I've no motivation to do anything, I've practically stopped showering, cooking anything beyond soup packs and the occasional rice, occasionally I eat out and the rest of the time I just don't eat. 

Pretty sure I'm full on diabetic by now, 3-4 years ago I was told I was pre-diabetic and was supposed to monitor myself. I did that for maybe a year because my roommate at the time kept bugging me about it but since I moved away from there I pretty much *lost* the machine somewhere and have been giving 0 fucks about it.  I'm not doing any work on the house, even work that I could do for practically free, hell the only reason the house looks as clean as it currently does is because of those people visiting for the room.

I've a collection of games that borders on hoarders territory and yet for the past month almost all I've been *playing* is Minecraft, not because it's fun but because it's an endless amount of mindless clicking that gets me through the evening until I'm finally exhausted enough to fall asleep which usually winds up being 5am with me having to wake up at 7:30 for another slog through life, work and pointless social interactions. 

In the past two weeks I've actually been contemplating hanging myself but then I remember that I'm a fatass and my house is falling apart so with my luck the roof would likely collapse from my weight and just give me an injury that would render me unable to finish the job. Also considered strapping something to my bikes exhaust and finding a way to make an air tight seal but I'm not handy enough to pull that shit off.

I was considering joining the whole secret Santa thing because even though I'm practically broke and effectively miserable I might as well at least try to make 1 person happy and maybe karma will kick in and I'll get hit by a truck or something but even that is seemingly requiring an insane amount of effort to fill out all the stuff they want to know. 

Every task I do always seems to start with \*sigh\* ""I'm so fucking tired of this shit...""

**TD;DR:** If you're too lazy to read fuck off. I'm just venting anyway.

**Sidenote:** If I get any ""don't do it"", ""it gets better"" ""try yoga/meditation/excercise"" responses I swear to fuck I will... probably silently rage and curse at you while wishing I could go Liam Neeson's taken on your ass because fuck actually doing it would take effort and energy I don't have.

I had been doing very well. Feeling good. Symptoms of depression and the ""noise"" in my head was quiet. Last night, I was taking a shower and the ""noise"" started again. At first I ignored it because that's the habit I built. Then I recognized it and started to worry. I thought: ""I've been doing so well, but I'm scared something bad is about to happen."" Anyway, I got out of the shower practicing deep breathing and long story short, there was an ""episode."" The details don't matter as much as the fact that my emotions got the better of me and it all unraveled like it always does. 

Today, I'm back to trying hard. Back to finding pauses and breathing and trying not to beat myself up for a backslide. But the thing is, the episode was with the person I love most in the whole world and I'm realizing that because of BPD my emotions are not usually accurate to a given situation. I have many questions. Do I know what love is? Do I understand what it feels like to be loved? When I do something that is motivated from a place of kindness do I understand how the rest of the world perceives that? I guess I think I'm lost because I feel scared that I don't really know what real emotions are. Real being defined as in a healthy context. If I can't love someone in a way that is healthy and normal then why love at all? It seems that its damaging to me as well as them, right?

Anyway, I'm new here and I apologize for the ramble. I'm just really confused. Don't know what my future holds or how to be ""myself"" again...or if ""myself"" is what I want to return to. Any comments, thoughts or help are appreciated.",BPD,t5_2qqdp,Thought I was Doing So Well

I feel like my depression can't/won't be taken seriously because I'm not like that, though. I have a 3.9 GPA at university. I have A's in all of my classes right now. Most of my professors really like me. I have friends. No one knows that I regularly contemplate suicide, sometimes over the smallest stressors and seemingly insignificant problems. No one knows that I have mini-breakdowns several times a week. No one knows that I sometimes go to bed at 4 in the afternoon because I'm just too tired to carry on. My life revolves around grades and schoolwork but there's little else to it. But to anyone on the outside, it must be hard to imagine that anything is wrong with me. I have to wonder if anyone would believe me if I tried to tell them.

At the same time I'm really scared because my depression is progressing. I feel like it's eating me from the inside out and like my exterior is on the verge of cracking. I can't concentrate on reading, I forget things constantly, I'm tired all the time, I can't articulate and explain things very well in person (which makes being called on in class really embarrassing).

It's always gone in the same cycle - find someone nice, I go weird, they hit me, I get weirder, they hit me more, we break up. 

Found out I had BPD just over a year ago and it changed things. Totally turned my life around in terms of work and friends because I know what I have and I can work with it (note that's ""I can"", not ""It's easy to""...) I have a great Doctor and Psych. and put in a lot of work to function and hold together a ""normal"" life. 

But can't get the dating thing together. I'm 30 now, been single around 7 years and it's the one thing I just can't seem to get right. Keep signing up to OKCupid and deleting a few days later because all I get is abuse. I thought it was me coming across weird in my profile so deleted everything but the photo - still just got messages telling me I was ugly, I was stupid, I should kill myself... I block them and report them and the next day there's another one. 

When I *do* get a message that isn't just a string of insults, I can't deal with it. I don't want to stick around to find it's just another idiot playing games. So I delete my profile and a few weeks later I go back because I would actually like to meet someone. 

I can see the obvious answer is ""meet someone IRL"" except I have no idea where to do this. I work ridiculous hours, in a job I love. The only place I go that isn't work is the supermarket and nobody fun shops at 2am. Meeting someone at work isn't an option - apart from students, I only speak to two people and neither of them are datable. 

Talking to one of the few people I actually trust a few weeks ago, he suggested that I use this time to focus on myself - which sounds like good advice, except I can't. All I focus on is the fact I'm 30, been single most of my adult life, never had a serious relationship, never had a relationship that wasn't abusive and it's looking more and more like I never will have a ""real"" relationship, a family or anything else that I sort of wanted to have in my life. Which makes me depressed... and I guess you all know how that goes.

I'm five-foot four inches, I weigh 94 pounds, I'm in the 9th grade, I have short brown hair, and whatever is causing these feelings is getting out of control.


It's not like I want to kill myself or hurt myself, I just don't want to be anything really. I don't want to have to wake up every morning, drag myself through school, and go home just to lie in bed, blow off homework, and cry myself to sleep. Today my father texted me about bad grades, he was furious. I remember that I was in third period. He was so mad because I'm an amazing student. I have the potential to graduate next year (I'd be a sophomore) and I'm damn near failing everything. I had tried to talk to my mom about whatever this is two times beforehand. I explained that I really had no motivation to do anything, ever, and that I was sad all the time. Even playing DOTA, which was my favorite thing to do, is now completely bland and void of all pleasure. When I got home my mom talked to me, I explained that I was doing so badly because I never gave anything I had to work on outside of school a second look because I'd rather not end up wanting to kill myself over something so petty as homework. My dad came to my room to talk to me. Just a precursor, I have two monitors, and a computer with a R9 280x and an i7-4790k, 8tb of HDD storage, and some other stuff that isn't relevant to anything at all. He screamed at me, the only reason he got through high school is because he played football for them, he was the popular kid. He always loves to tell me stories about how he would have so much sex, and he'd always be invited to parties, and how much fun he would have bullying and beating up the nerds and kids who played DnD. Apparently they deserved it because they were smarter than him and he found that annoying. I am the perfect representation of that kind of person today. He came in to my room and after screaming at me asked my why I was doing so badly. I told him the same thing I told my mother. I told him calmly he couldn't blow this off and that I needed help, seriously. He then kicked over my then-running computer and hit both of my monitors, as well as knocking over my oculus rift. He proceeded to slap me, grab me by my legs and throw me off of my bed. He told me this was my fault, and I shouldn't put my shit on him. He doesn't think depression or any similar illnesses actually exist. I checked my computer and peripherals, everything seems to be working perfectly. I'm lucky he didn't fuck one of my hard drives, or that fluid from my cooling loop didn't spill everywhere and break everything. I have one person that I talk to about everything. Her name is Ava. I met her by photoshopping her face on to somebody that had bullied me, because on the bully's twitter there was a very funny picture of Ava that I thought was hilarious. Ava didn't like that at the time, and when school started I made an effort to talk to her. We became best friends, I absolutely love Ava and she's one of the best people I've ever met. I can tell her about anything, and she'll try her best to give me positive feedback, but I feel like being this way I'm leeching the life out of her and I don't want to hurt her like that. My days consist of waking up far to early, with far too little sleep. I usually get 2-4 hours of sleep, if I'm lucky. Sleeping is hard to do now, it used to be how I solved all my problems. I go to school and I drag through every class I have. Most of them are full of people far older than I, most of which with completely incompetent teachers who don't really understand what they're talking about. The only classes I'm taking that are meant for those In my grade are classes I'm mandated to take by the school system, these are torturous. There's this one child that shares a name with me. Anthony. I'm short, pretty ugly, I wear solely graphic tees for producers that I like, and I don't have many friends at all, but a lot of the people I'm stuck with are completely opposite. Anthony. He's stunningly attractive, hilarious, and has an impeccable fashion sense. He was held back in the 8th grade, he should be a sophomore this year, but he isn't. People love him. I hear my name, every hour of every day, and when I turn to respond I'm met with ""ew, not you, the other Anthony!"". Does anybody know how demoralizing that is? I want this all to stop, I want to get into a good college, go through medical school, and become a successful oncologist, but at this rate it isn't happening. When I was little, my dad forced me to play baseball and basketball. I hated them, and never wanted to play. He made me pitch and play 3rd. I never wanted to play, but he wouldn't be happy unless I was a baseball prodigy. I'd be making millions of dollars a year playing for some major team and I could pay for his luxury life. He wanted me to be what he had the potential to be. He always thought I was slow, or that I had a horribly inaccurate pitch, but in reality I'd run slow on purpose. I wanted to get out. I'd throw balls out of the park on purpose, I wanted the game to end.  Even now I can't go to the state-mandated gym class without wanting to cry. I see people bigger, more attractive, and better than me doing things I could never even think about doing. It's not that I'm jealous of them. It's just that it's so damaging to me. The first week of school the thundercunt who ""teaches"" gym had us all run miles. I walked mine as a form of silent protest. I took 20 minutes, I was so proud. The look of disgust on his face pleased me so much. It sounds horrible, but I hate him just because he ""teaches"" gym. It wasn't just him. Most of the people I see now I legitimately want dead, for no other reason than that they exist. It's like looking at people makes me sad, and because of this I just want them all to die. I guess I feel like they're better than me. In my bullshit computer class that were supposed to be taking THREE YEARS TO LEARN FUCKING PYTHON IN we've so far made, A.Fucking career portfolios, B.Flow charts on every day activities, C.We've started with scratch. FUCKING SCRATCH. Did I mention this is an honors level class meant for juniors and seniors? I know Java, C++, and a few other languages fluently enough to be able to talk about them pretty well, and I'm in a class with seniors who are so fucking incompetent and illiterate that they can't fucking find their way around scratch. Our computer science teacher called me out when I said that Scratch doesn't really have any learning value for anyone older than 5, maybe 10 if they're slow. And when I said that she should really learn more before teaching a computer class, when she said that windows and Mac make up all of today's computers. I went off. She completely excluded Unix and linux environments, along with other systems. This woman who is at least 900 years old and completely illiterate is trying to teach us python over the course of three years by having us do simple stuff in scratch???????? Python is a fucking joke of a language. Another good example is when I was ""called out"" for trying to explain that, yes Coach Dickwad, we do in fact use 100% of our brains, not 33%, and that an FMRI would clearly show this. Where the fuck did he even get that number from?! Another great example is when I got called out by my completely insane math teacher for politely abstaining from the pledge of allegiance. Now my days consist of coming home, listening to Deadmau5, Burial, Blackmill, and various releases on Monstercat, as well as talking to Ava and just trying to keep myself going long enough to get happy. I guess I just came here to rant about how I find my life shit. My mom has scheduled a meeting with a therapist, and if the therapist thinks I need it I may eventually end up with an antidepressant or something similar to one prescription. I don't want to turn into an emotionally devoid zombie. Will they do that to me? I've heard they can. Thank you guys for reading, I may post again if I feel the need.

Again, I'll start by saying that I have very bad anxiety (generalised anxiety disorder), OCD which hit me with a vengeance and is starting to run over my life, and depression which I believe has turned clinical. 
I’m freaking out. While being in a very weak emotional state, I met this girl from Spain through Yahoo Answer (ughh..) about 2 years ago, and as soon as I gave her my email she started writing on a daily basis, very long emails. Back then she was married to a 65-year-old man while she was living in Ibiza. She’s 26. Then they moved to the UK, and she ditched him for a 60-year-old man, who she ditched as well. Then she started writing even more, and wanted me to go to the UK, etc. Since I was not an EU citizen back then, I could not go there save as a tourist. Then I suffered a broken ankle when a car almost ran me over the night of a big soccer game, and my family would not help out, as I’m a shame to them since I’m not rich, have all these emotional maladies, tend to repeat my worries over and over again (OCD) and get episodes where I get really down and cannot move – literally. They see me as a burden and my siblings told before to me just go ahead and kill myself. My self-esteem has been on the floor for most of my life. 

So once I told her about the broken ankle she started to send me funds from the UK – and I didn’t even want them. She kept on insisting, and yeah, I accepted. Once I got the funds, she said that “the tables have turned”, meaning that she is in control. And what fucking control she got. She ended up booking a ticket over here without warning and just flew over across the ocean. Then all hell broke loose:

So far she has proven to be a militant an extreme vegan who lives in her own fantasy world, and who is seriously psychotic, and I don't think one needs to be a shrink to figure this out. For example, a couple of week ago I was seriously depressed and she got a fit of rage where she was banging and the walls and scratching her face. 

She locks herself in the other room of the apartment for 24 hours straight whenever she disagrees with anything I have to say. There are no windows in that room, but she says that they’re safe of “evil entities”. She always wanted to boss me around, tell me what to eat, how to breathe (no joke), I could never wear shoes, or get a haircut (short hair isn’t a man’s natural spiritual state, according to her). I could not call people from the apartment because she would hear everything, and the list goes on. She says that Cornwall is her “Home” and that she wanted to “save me” and take me there. She also thinks that she’ll live to be at least 200-years-old and is not human, but from an extraterrestrial species. It’s fucked up, to say the least. 

She also blames me constantly for everything – she said that she can understand why my family hates me, and does not understand how my job still keeps me in their payroll (I’ve been working writing articles for quite a few years for the same company).  She says other horrible and hurtful things, and her levels of manipulation are immense. All of these things led me to drink every day, and I don’t see myself as a big drinker at all, and I was gambling, but completely stopped this completely.

We got married 5 to 6 months ago. She manipulated me into getting married when I was having huge doubts about this. Now she made the decision to divorce me, but doesn’t want to wait here in Costa Rica to get one, so she wants me to go to Europe just to get it. I don’t fucking care anymore. I just want this person out of my life, as my emotional health is very messed up, and I already landed in the hospital for an overdose. I hung a rope from the ceiling about 2 weeks ago and took it out before she came back, since I couldn't follow the plan to end myself. Now I’m really desperate and don’t know what to do. 

She came back a couple of days ago from Nicaragua in a trip to make her visa run (her status here in Costa Rica is a tourist), and the days when she was away were much better than when she was here.  She came back and hell broke loose again. 

In the last few weeks before her trip, she had a massive fit where she woke up 3-year-old kids in the neighbours’ house with her screaming, and I spoke to the neighbours about it.  They also have a 5-year-old son who she woke up at 3am or 4am, scaring the living shit out of him. 

Last night she was  chatting online to somebody at about 4am with the lights on while laughing, and I had a nightmare. Her mocking laughter mixed with my nightmare and I got up and told her to keep it down, that there were children next door. I told her this before, as well, and she did not care – she put her music at very high volumes. 

After I told her to keep the noise down, she locked herself in the other room. Now I’m at my job and don’t know where to go if she doesn't let me in the house after work. My conscience is clear – I never EVER did ANYTHING wrong or abusive to her in any way, - it’s the other way around - but I did react sternly last night telling her to keep quiet. I fear that I won’t be able to go back home. I owe her a week of rent, which I will pay on Monday. I’m trying to recover financially – besides emotionally. I’m broke now and have to figure out how to make it until Monday so I can move out. No, I am not asking for help in that sense – just need to see how to keep my cool until I make it back home this evening. That’s basically it. I’m freaking out and my heart is about be ripped off my chest - pumping really hard - as I write this. Any advice on what to do would be appreciated.

So in an attempt to get sympathy, or attention, or to try and get rid of these god damn intrusive thoughts, I'll just post them here:

*The best that I can be isn't good enough. I'm human garbage. I deserve to be alone. I deserve to suffer. I'm lazy, I'm fat, I'm a liar. I'm an attention whore sometimes. I'm overly dramatic. I can't cope with my emotions so I push them inward. Whenever I feel good about myself it's an illusion. I'm broken and I'm not worth fixing. I'm never going to get better. I'm not worth anything. It amazes me that I have friends but I can't imagine anyone ever loving me. Could I love back? Do I even know what love is, or do I have it confused with something else? Obsession? I've been told I'm creepy. It's probably true. But this is just the way I am and I can't change. I don't even know what's wrong. I'm creepy if I try interacting with people, and I'm a freak if I shut myself off. So when I do interact with people, I constantly judge myself, I constantly analyze. I can't turn it off. This is suffering. This is the kind of thing that makes suicide seem like a viable way out. The humane option. The right thing to do.*

I'm getting worse. Way worse. Fuck.

Edit: and I'm not depressed because I got raped, I don't have low self-esteem because my parents ignored me. I'm just... defective! If I could point to a specific thing that broke me, maybe I could figure out how to fix it, but there's just nothing, there's just me. It's horseshit and I'm sick of it. I'm sick of being mentally ill and not knowing why. It's not *fair*! I do my best, I keep it restrained, I hate myself some more. I tell my friends about it and they don't leave, they don't help, they just awkwardly ignore it. I don't want to push it because I don't want to lose them, but I don't know what to do and I want to cry but no tears come and I'm not making sense so I'm going to stop writing but fucking hell, why can't I say what I want to say? There's no word for the way I feel about myself. I mean, it's like hatred, but there's a whole other dimension to it that I can't put into words, and I just think in circles trying to put it to words.

~~Other people, other people might flourish if they were put in a different environment. Other people might get better if they learn to cope with their issues. But I have nothing to cope with, because I am the problem, and the problem is me. Depression has co-opted my identity, it's absorbed me, and no matter what I try to do I just sink deeper and deeper and it feels like there's no escape. I've been depressed, I've been existential, I've been mad, but this... This *fury* I feel toward myself. You're getting help, you dumb fuck! Why won't you get better? Jesus Christ, you're so stupid. So pathetic. Nobody wants you, and rightly, because you're a piece of shit that doesn't want to get better. If you keep living you'll end up dying alone anyway so why not just get it over with?~~

I have no idea where I'm going in life. I have terrible grades but a loving family who do everything right. I used to be into sports and was set on turning professional now I haven't done any physical exercise at all in 5 weeks. I started getting back into music and I'm in a band with a bunch of guys that really don't care about it any more than a little hobby to play at school shows for friends. I'm in my final year of high-school, my friends are all applying to Ivy League's and I'm scared about not getting into any universities. I can't do anything at all to sit down and work, I literally cannot concentrate I just get restless and distracted and I hate myself for it but can't do anything. I've never had a girlfriend, all my friends don't care about me. I tried talking to my so called ""best friends"" who i've known almost 9 years now and no one does anything other than the usual ""i hope it gets better, seriously man anything you need I'm here for you"" but in reality they couldn't care less and really if I died tonight they would probably get over it within a few days. I have these dreams that I'm never going to accomplish and I'm going to end up wasting away doing just enough to get by or killing myself. I went to a psychiatrist and I'm speaking to my school counsellor and I'm on both Ritalin (ADD medication) and Ixel (anti-depressant) I can't tell if its working. Occasionally I'll have a phase of calm and a small moment of just being ok but it'll all fade away and I panic and can't do anything and want to just die. I literally wan't to just sleep forever. I love being able to just go to bed at night and not care about life or anyone or anything but whenever I wake up in the morning I hate myself and wish I could just disappear. I don't want it to be a dramatic thing where I kill myself and everyone cries and hates me for it and wishes they had done something (or at least tells everyone that). I want to just sleep and not wake up and everyone won't notice and I wont exist. 

I'm turning 17 in a couple of days. I don't know what to do. I'm not suicidal, I just wish I hadn't been given a life in the first place. I wish I could fully give myself up and just follow dreams and work on things that matter but I've given up and I don't know if I'm depressed or I'm just being a bitch.

It will, because it knows not know to deal with you. And that might seem terrible advice, but trust me, I'm alone, and afraid, and at my own wits-end.

Depression for me is both constant and seasonal. I'm kinda depressed during the summer months, but for the fall and winter and early spring months, I'm... just nearly gone.

""What does that mean?""

Imagine every part of you was weighted on the judgement of whether or not moving would be beneficial to your life at that distinct moment. Does going to the shower to clean up benefit your -total- life significantly? Probably not. But it does on the daily level. But a depressed person doesn't think of that. They think of how their bank balances are negative, or how their rent check is going to bounce.

Depression is when every single thing you've done wrong might just pop up and try to destroy you, when your defense is at it's least. You have no defense, and despite the fact you should. (At least in my case; ""I've written some music, I've drawn some things. I'm an artist."") In the grand scheme of things, that's nothing. No one funds you, no one looks at your work, no one cares about your work. No one seeks you. Your work might get shown beside someone else's, and that's the worst part. The artist who takes your work and profits directly off of it won't nod to you at all. They get the fame for your music while your name sits aside on a credits page to maybe get an E-mail every once or twice a year.

Life becomes shitty, and honestly you seek escapes. You seek anything that can get you out of it. You run away, you want to hide. And that's the worst, because these jobs nowadays want those that are energetic and happy to deal with people.

You put on a mask. You start to build upon a fake version of yourself.

You go into work each day wearing that mask, hiding what you really want to do. You hide everything you feel, showing what you think others should feel the entire time. Just hoping that they won't fire you. Just hoping that you make each paycheck. And then you find your paychecks won't make the rent. Then you get loans. Then you find you can't pay them back in time.

This is your life. A fake version of yourself blamed for all this stupid shit. And you're inside of yourself just constantly huddled in a ball and crying. You just try and whether the storm. Hoping for the day when maybe you can make a difference. When people might see you're a good writer, or a artist, or a musician, or what have you.

But until then, you will suffer. And frankly, your work might not be celebrated until years after, like Van Gogh.

Frankly, that is what scares me. That is my view on it. I'm alone, afraid, and almost beyond help, and asking for help, monetarily, is a goddamned nightmare, because I sit and cry for days after I do so, because I feel so bad.

I think I'm going to die here, by this system, this world, those around me asking for so much when I've given all that I can. I sit alone, watching what I barely make going to my rent and internet and utilities, and I realize I have two weeks per month with no food. Maybe I didn't think it through enough. But I need people to talk to, and I need water, and I need a place to stay...

I really hate depression. And all I want in my life, and I ask that all the time, ""Do you know what I want?"" to myself. And the only thing I wish for is just knowing I don't have to be afraid anymore. Just that I can relax for a moment. Just that I can maybe, perhaps maybe, actually afford gifts for others this christmas. In the last 6 years, I've -never- been able to buy gifts. I can't remember the last gifts I've bought for someone.

I don't honestly know if I could deal with depression with all the other things taken care of, honestly. That's what scares me. Even if I was comfortable, would I be able to be happy?

I have tried online dating, I get messages and likes, iv even set up dates or just a time to go for a drink, over the past year iv set up 9 dates, iv been stood up or dropped every time, iv had guys say they like me then just ask for nudes then be abusive when I say no, and even when j do and ask about the date we set I get answers, even now i have 2 guys who live very close who said they want to meet and now won't even reply or when they do they just cut out.

I feel cold all.the time , i can hardly sleep or eat, when i do i dream and its amazing, i wake up happy but then i realise and i drop back down, when i do eat its loads and fast just to fill up the hole in me.

Id be happy with dog Or cat, next doors cat loves me, she is the only one who i can cry with and she will stay or not judge me, she ver asks for anything and js always there for me,, i find it hard most day's when I'm not in college tl focus on reality and not slip away, i hate my life so much, i have everything exept the one thing i want the most.

She is my life and I love her very much. 3 weeks ago we ended up breaking up when I didnt even see it coming and I got no explanation. A week after that she started to date a guy who well lets just say has been an issue with our relationship because I didnt like the guy and well I told her I never wanted to talk to her again. A week ago they break up we keep talking and she told me the real reason why she broke up. 

She was raped many times over as a kid by the same man. Her dad was in the same house when it happened and he supposedly was passed out drunk but I am not sure because this happened for 3 years. Later and this was after we broke up like she told me a week ago that this continued for another two years after when she was 11. When it happened it was usually 3 or 4 men doing this to her. She went through complete hell through all of this. I was the first person she ever trusted to tell me this stuff and I did know some things but I learned the last part after. One of the guys lives close to her grandma and sometimes when he sees her he restrikes the fear in her.

Whenever he does do it I always get angry but I know to just be calm and caring for her. But the last few months we were together things got really hard. We seemed to fight more and get more upset and I for the life of me I didnt understand why. She told me a few nights ago that the reason why things became so hard was that one of her professors looks and sounds like one of the 4 men that did things to her. The man flirts with her and she tries really hard to not talk to him. 

Anyway we are still in a really weird situation after all the crap that happened over the last few weeks. I know she still loves me and cares as do I but she said just the fact a man touches her or looks at her she feels like they just want to rape her (she has even freaked out with me and I would never do anything to hurt her). I ask about the future and she says she sees us getting married but needs to figure out how to get over this. I stay because I do love her but we are still trying to figure out how to be friends because when we do hang out or talk its hard for me not to tell her I love her or look at her in that way. Idk if I should show those feelings at times or not. I really want to help her through this.

I did tell her that this friendship is hers to control. The speed and everything is hers to control. But last night I did do something stupid that involves trying to hurt myself because of one of the things she did to me.

Next your introvertedness begins to creep in more and you pass on more invitations and eventually get less and less. People start wondering where you are, this makes you even more anxious and cycles like that.

A little while later you feel good/happy and ready to socialise a bit with your friends, people you view as quite close and get on with. Little  have you realised what has gone on in the intermediary period between when you have seen them and now, whether that be holidays, birthdays,  new relationships, gossip, drama (Which i hate) and such.

You message them and plan to come to the next birthday party/ social event and are met with some 'Zensama!', 'Are you even coming?', 'Whoa Zensama is coming', like it's a big deal. 

In a way this makes you feel like your friends care and that they are looking forward to seeing you again, which is great.

Little do you know that you will faced with almost interrogatory levels of questioning regarding your whereabouts the past x weeks/months (You can tell genuine concern quite easily), paired with public 'I never see you!'s but the absolute WORST is the 'see you in like... a month or two!' in a jeering fashion while everyone is there, plus a sort of cold demeanour to your interactions, people not holding eye contact, not joking with you like they did.

Everything that falls into my hands, I end up breaking it.

Everything that touches me withers and decays.

Everything that keeps me living, I fucking hate.

Chances, I choke them until they stop breathing.

Love, I keep burning away until there’s nothing.

Everything that keeps me living, I fucking hate.

They might as well call them sex depressants. My body responds to nothing. NOTHING. I'm Alan Rickman in Dogma when I'm on Prozac, which is a challenge for my marriage.

Anyway, so sometimes...I stop taking them. I read somewhere that long-term use of SSRIs can PERMANENTLY damage your ability to get back a sex drive, which terrifies me, so sometimes I stop taking it for a while, just to make sure I can still physically orgasm. This leads to me forgetting that I need antidepressants to prevent, you know, depression.

Anyway, naturally, I started getting depressed. So depressed I started feeling like I was dissociating from reality, which was terrifying, so I panicked and took a double dose of my medication for like a week. The jolt to my system (or a placebo effect, because I know that's not how they work) worked like a miracle. I even started feeling well-rested in the mornings, which hasn't happened in probably a year. I stopped taking them again though, because GODDAMMIT I WANT TO WANT SEX AS MUCH AS I DON'T WANT TO BE SUICIDAL.

Yeah, I have my emotional maladies which include generalised anxiety disorder which has been horrible lately, depression which can turn clinical, and OCD which gets in the way of pretty much everything. However, I don't harm others in any way and know right from wrong, in direct contrast to my wife.

I'll just say what happened again: 

We met on Yahoo Answers a couple of years ago, I was an emotional mess and constantly sad, she broke up with a boyfriend that could be her grandfather (he's about 65 and she's 26) then left him for a 60 year old guy, then somehow broke up with him and had the police involved, and continued writing me her daily 2000 word daily emails. I broke my ankle in a road accident, my family wouldn't help me, so she did, and I didn't want her help until she kept on insisting, and seeing that I was in a cast and on crutches I had no choice but to accept it. She eventually flew over from the UK to see me, and bought the ticket without even telling me. She wanted to ""save me"" from living here in Costa Rica and from my ""evil ways"" (going out and having a couple of beers after work, but not getting wasted - save on few occassions).

We got married 5 or 6 months ago here - I was in a terrible inner state, holding on to her promise that we would move to Cornwall in the UK, because according to her it's where ""Home"" is, and she pushed me for the marriage. Seeing that I was not well enough to make a decision, I gave in and married her.

The facts are that she turned out to be psychotic - or something like that. I am no shrink, but a toddler would be scared to death of her episodes. She's a militant vegan living in her fantasy world, and so far she threw tantrums like the girl from the Exorcist, insulted me in the most vile ways, tried to tell me how to breathe, how to eat, what to wear (shorts and sandals), to never cut my hair (she says that it's not man's natural state to have short hair), to eat what she eats (grains, pasta, and tofu - almost no vegetables because the plants die), etc.. I've never been treated like such a piece of shit in my life, but was afraid to leave her out of loneliness. She also spoke foul about me all over the internet. 

Now she wants a divorce, but wants it to be done in Europe, so she wants me to go there just for the divorce. Ordering me to do so, pretty much. Here in Costa Rica a divorce can take time, but in Spain (where she's from) it's easy. i want the divorce as well, and to break free from this person, but yeah, I still love her - I don't know how I get this feeling despite all the shit that she did and continues to do. 

Every word I utter can be a reason for her to throw a tantrum, and she's thrown them at 4am with a 5 year old child sleeping in the neighbour's house right next to where we live. She woke him up and other kids (..and these were 3-years-old!!!) sleeping there in the neighbour's house. She scared the living shit out of the kids by banging the walls and screaming like a lunatic. 

Now we sleep in separate rooms - I close the door and sometimes lock it, and decided to not speak to her, save for text messages and written notes, but I feel like I'm getting really depressed just by having her around. I have no time to properly move out until Friday, and in a marriage here she would get the edge if I move out just like that - it's called ""home abandonment"" and she can start all kinds of shit for me. I would also be taking away her internet connection, and since she's here as a tourist, it might not be so easy for her to a get a contract, but I'm not sure. She would have to wait a few days (enough time for her to get really crazy - more than he already is) and start some shit. 

I do not know what to do. She's evil and psychotic but I love her and don't know how to break free. I also don't know if keeping silent is the best way to go until she leaves the country (2-3 weeks tops, according to her). She also doesn't believe in doctors of any type - especially shrinks and medication. 

I'm on medication, but this constant emotional abuse is too much to bear, and don't know how to deal with it. I feel like I'm allowing her to push me to end myself. Already been in the hospital due to overdoses, and had a rope hanging from the ceiling a few weeks ago. I'm scared shitless. I'm am NOT asking for attention or pity. I'm just desperate and looking for a way to emotionally break free from the poisonous clutches of this woman with a very twisted soul. 

Any advice on how to deal with this would be more that welcome. Thank you.

Jumping off a building...  Funny thing.  I'm in NYC, with TONS of buildings, and can't find one to do it.  I've done a lot of research on this, and so many people have survived even from jumping off a 6th floor! I know there are taller buildings, but those are not easy to get into, unless you know someone that lives or works in one, and again, I don't want to make them feel guilty for using them for that.
I've found some of those multilevel parking buildings, but the highest one I've found is just 4 stories.

Jumping off a bridge, same thing. Too many survive.  I could ""stop swimming"", but I'm realistic, and understand my body and mind will trigger my survival instincts and will eventually try and swim up for air.

Swallowing pills, I've done it **three times**, and nothing.  My body just end up vomiting them.

Hanging myself, I've done some research on this as well.  My ceiling is not high enough for it, that's if I want to do it quick.

Poison.  Ok, yes, I guess I could do some of that, but just because I want to commit suicide, it doesn't mean I want my last moments to be a slow painful death.  Yeah, I'll die anyway, but again... I don't want it to be that painful.

Cutting wrists, same as above.

Cyanide pills seem almost impossible to find.  I wonder how people even come across them.  I remember last year, some guy had a whole bag of them, he managed to get into the train tunnels, to commit suicide alone, without bothering anyone.  Police arrested him, they thought he was going to leave a bomb or something.  I digress, he managed to get whole bag of them.

I'm tired of feeling sorry for myself.  I've asked for help, and I've received it.  I have a lot of emotional support, a lot of people love me, I have a very social life with a lot of friends.

My therapist had ""fit me in"" after I had emailed her from our first session explaining that I didn't appreciate the way she'd treated me and the concerns I had going forward (but that's another story). She called me and apologized for the first session so I agreed to a 2nd session and rearranged my work schedule to be there.

So I'm on my way there and I realize I don't have money for parking. So I call and ask if they know anywhere nearby I can park for free and walk. They told me that they'd give me a parking voucher this one time and I just had to park in the main garage.
I find the garage and park and find out I have about a fifteen minute walk to my appt that I'm already late for. So I call my therapist and tell her, and she tells me to still come and we will make the most of the time. I'm rushing by this point and in my haste I tripped and twisted my ankle really bad

I called back and said I really didn't see the point in keeping the appt since we would only have like 15 mins by the time I got there
She told me to still come in and we'd make the best of the time; so I hobbled over and when I got there we barely had time to do anything.
She gave me some resources and recommendations (keep in mind this was only our 2nd session, we don't really know each other at this point). And asked me about what I was seeking therapy for.
So I was honest with her and told her what was happening, that I was diagnosed with BPD, that I was under a lot of stress and having trouble managing my emotions. 

She asked if I was having suicidal thoughts. I said that I've thought about it at least once a day since my teens (this is true, and I only recently became aware that not everyone does this and it generally is not considered normal). And that I was seeking therapy because they were getting more intense. She confirmed my next appt. and told me she was taking me to have my ankle looked at.

She lied.

She had ""pink slipped"" me and ordered me held for a psych evaluation and I was taken by 3 security guards to the ER where I was detained.
They checked me in and put me in a room and offered me a phone to call people and tell them where I was and that I wouldn't be out for a while.
They said it would be several hours before I could see a psychiatrist.
I tried to tell them this was unacceptable. That I had obligations and responsibilities and I needed to pick up my son.
They said ""call someone to do it for you.""
I said ""I can't.""
They said. ""Find someone.""
I said, ""there is no one.""
they said where's his mother
I said in the James cancer hospital undergoing treatment for cancer. and not available.
I said ""I'm sure I'm not the only person to come in here in this situation and what do you do?""
They said there's nothing they can do.
I told them I had to leave.
They said if I tried 8 security guards would put me to the ground and sedate me.
They said they'd call social services about my son.
At that point I sort of went numb and accepted that I didn't have a say. So I called my mom to pick up my son and waited to see a psychiatrist. Keep in mind I got there at 10am.

The med team came in to take care of my ankle.

Hours later a social worker came to interview me.

Before that though, I asked if there was a way to page someone and explain my situation. they got in my face like inches away from my nose and said ""This is your Borderline coming through. You're manic. Are you manic?""

I said I didn't expect to be detained against my will and I didn't know how to answer that.

When the social worker came I asked for food. He said he'd bring some back and disappeared. An hour later I asked the nurse for food because I still hadn't had anything. She brought me a pot roast dinner and said ""careful, its hot"" and set it down in front of me and it had ice crystals on it still.
So I was terrified of causing any trouble and giving them any reason to keep me, so I ate my frozen meal...
Then the social worker came to interview me, and left to talk to the psychiatrist. When he came back he said they wanted to keep me overnight.
I told him this was not okay with me and I would sign myself out AMA if necessary.

He went to talk to the psychiatrist again.

They came in and interviewed me again.

They told me I was detained b/c of suicidal thoughts and my therapist had said I had a plan and didn't discuss prevention. Said this made me angry because it was a lie and was not true. I explained my support network, and how I had recruited three friends to call in crisis. They went away again.

Next I received discharge papers and finally went home. It was 7pm. I was held, threatened, mistreated and frightened. All because I asked a therapist for help.

first off, i found this place through Chris Sander's youtube video about depression and helping yourself.

as for what im feeling, well, my depression stems from a few major things

a. Motivational problems.

b. Feeling accepted for who i am or making a name for myself

c. worrying about small things too much

d. Worrying about my weight.

e. Weather screws my mood over too

as for what each of these mean, heres the deal

a. I have a HUGE BACKLOG of Games, Movies, Books, Cards, the works that i have untouched or unplayed, and it really makes me feel bad when i think about them. Game Bundles and Steam sales are like crack to me. I am also an impulse shopper, though ive been working at that. Also i play World of Warcraft a LOT which makes it harder to play through my non WOW stuff 

b.  Sometimes i feel like i follow trends too much, I feel like i havent really made a name or identified my area of specialty. I have a good job delivering papers at a hospital, but i still wonder if people accept me for who i really am.

c. You know the expression dont make a mountain out of a molehill? I tend to do that quite a bit, and apologize and say sorry WAY more than i should, and i have patience issues as well.

d. This is where the cylical part of my problem begins, when i get depressed or feel down, i eat a lot. Henceforth i feel bad about my weight

e. Dark nights or heavy weather like rain dampens my mood a lot, and that never helps me out.

I'm already taking steps to help with my depression a bit, like getting a kitty for my apartment. I sometimes wonder if thats enough, or if theres somethign more i can do, hope to hear back or get feedback

PS: I hope im doing this right, i also posted this in the getting over it and get motivated sub reddits as well

I know me better than you - and even I can't make me happy.  Hearing half assed 'oh....that sucks' and generic life advice I'm well aware of doesn't fucking help.

In fact, it kind of makes shit worse.  It makes me feel even more alienated.  Every time I go to someone for advice or even just to bitch and moan and feel the total disconnect and lack of interest in my problems, it fucking hurts.  It hurts when I will spend days or weeks trying to help someone with their problems and investing actual effort into helping them, and know that my problems either don't have a solution - or no one is willing to put any effort into helping me find one.

Furthermore, I'm even more of a piece of shit when I'm in one of my moods and way more combative than usual - and I'm already pretty standoffish.  So, if I *do* go to you when I'm depressed, chances are I'm just driving people away one bitchfest at a time.

and as far as the 'always' part of that?  No, seriously.  I think of killing myself daily - or if things are particularly bad, hourly.  No, I can't always go to you, that would not be fair to you - or shit, even my therapist.  This is my burden.

So, not only are others incapable of helping, but the act of going to them may actually create an immediate negative effect (feeling disconnected and further hopeless when they are of no help) but also a long term negative impact (pissing off friends/loss of friends).

And shit, the people that CAN actually help who say that?  They're the ones who send me a hello, and then ignore my 4 messages to chitchat spanned out throughout the month.  I really fucking don't get people sometimes.

Edit:  okay, talking to people can help, but, not for the 'im here for you' reasons and I've discovered a bit of why.  Forcing it 'hey be nice to me because im depressed' sucks.  When people come to you that you haven't spoken to in ages and give you just some genuine human interaction that gives you motivation for shit, then, that helps.",depression,t5_2qqqf,"""You know you can always talk to me"" No, I can't.

it's just stupid.  i built a house when i was 15, built a race car in college, all this other shit just to ""keep developing my skills"".  but that was all a fucking fascade too.  who the fuck cares what you do?  no one.

yeah cool, i built a fucking car, not like it advances the good of the human race at all.

i should have just gotten drunk, done drugs, and tried to sleep with sluts all the time.  then maybe id fit in.  then maybe people would look at me with sympathy and try to get me help instead of thinking i was just fine.

probably no one thinks im just fine, im probably just a fucking narcissist.  i think its normal for me to have the mentality i have after all i've been through.  the only way you stand up to people telling you you arent worth shit is to tell yourself that you're awesome and keep proving that to yourself with things like race cars and engineering degrees.  But you know what?  Am i actually better?  Probably not, i'm nothing like these other yuppy human beings who sit around and watch TV, chasing fun because they can actually relax.

yuppy's who think they're good people because their loving families and friends have told them that growing up.

well, you know what, ive been brainwashed the complete opposite i suppose.  i tell myself im awesome, i think im awesome, yet i truly feel terrible.  i have always truly felt terrible.

nearly every person ive met in life, ive regretted it later.  maybe some seem nice at first, but then they get comfortable with you, criticize you, play frivolously with your emotions, betray you.

fuck it all.

i could go on alone and be my own bastion, an independent beacon of coolness in some regard, but i cant.  i dont care any more.  i have no desire to prove myself to anyone anymore.  So, even if my previous mentality of trying to show people i am awesome wasn't a farce to begin with, what does it mean now?

I've been depressed since I was 7 years old. I'm 19 now. Going on twenty. Sometimes I'm okay. Usually I'm not. 

I feel so... pathetic. About everything. I don't have reasons for this shit. I'm not being abused. I'm not piss poor. I'm not dying of some rare illness.

I'm often told that I have a really nice smile. That I seem like the happiest person they know. That I'm jolly. But I'm not. My soul is cracked, broken, bleeding, weeping. I'm hopelessly, utterly, completely miserable. I'm the jolly fat guy to everyone else. More like the sad clown in reality. 

I'm pathetic. I went out with a girl that I have a thing for tonight (though it would never work, I'm not right for her) and got depressed as soon as I arrived home over my inability to seal the deal. Is there anything more cliched, more ridiculous, more filled with twelve year old angst than that?

To continue with the pathetic justification motif, I feel like I don't have any friends. I have acquaintances, many of whom genuinely like me for my winning smile and my goofiness. But no friends. No one I hang out with. No one I see outside of whatever class or activity is giving us a reason to be with each other. I did have one, but we had a fight and she refuses to talk to me. I think she got fed up with dealing with me. Oh well. Always happens eventually. 

My parents don't love me. Cool. Moving on. 

I honestly think that it'll happen. I barely stay afloat as it is. One day I think my strength will give out and I will just sink. And I think that day is coming soon.

Sorry for the rambling. Maybe I'll just go do it now. I'll probably pussy out though. Guess we'll have to wait and see. ",depression,t5_2qqqf,I feel like suicide is my destiny.

I met my wife a couple of years ago on Yahoo Answers (out of all places..) and she caught me while I was very weak emotionally and ended up flying from the UK to see me after I suffered a broken ankle and she helped me out financially. I refused her help but she kept on insisting, and since I was in a cast and could barely move, I accepted her help, then I felt somehow ""indebted"" towards her and accepted that she come over here to visit me - crossing the ocean. She was obsessed and kept saying that she loved me eternally, etc.. I thought that maybe she was the girl for me, and I was fucking wrong (pardon my French).
My family did not want to help me out when I had the broken ankle - they seem to see me as a burden and have a lot of contempt towards me, since I suffer from OCD, generalised anxiety disorder, and depression that can turn clinical, which shames them. I also don't have tons of money like the rest of them. In fact I'm quite the opposite, but I get by with what I make from my job.
My wife is a clear psychopath and could be a sociopath - she's like a bloody Nazi. It takes no shrink to figure this out. She's a militant vegan with extreme beliefs and a completely twisted and messed up view of reality, and wants to ""convert"" people to her beliefs and join the ""ONE"" in ""blissful veganism"". She also thinks that she'll live beyond 200, and is some kind of Jesus - not from this Earth, but here to save humanity. She also has extreme mood swings that include aggressive fits where she scratches her face and bangs the walls, screaming like crazy at 4am or 3am, and waking up the neighbours in the process - including 5 year children. Now she hates me and wants a divorce. I guess this is a good thing, as I fell into a very big depression in the year that we were together where I was holding on to life by a thread, and my emotional stability has been virtually assassinated by this individual. Yet I still have feelings for her, as she was not the beast that she turned out to be when she first came here, but became one after (before that she already had her fits) about 6 months of living together. She's from Spain and was living in Cornwall, UK, the place were she calls her ""HOME"", and will fly out on the 27th of this month. In the meantime, I'm under constant threat of not being able to go back to the apartment that we share after work. I risk being on the streets. I never did anything bad to her at all and never hurt her in any way. My conscience is clear in that sense. Hers isn't, if she happens to have a conscience.
Her vile words are horrible - she said that she didn't understand how my family could ever stand me, that she didn't get how my job put with me for 6 years. She also said that I was destined to be lonely for the rest of my life, and mind fucked me in the most crippling ways.
The funny thing is that my sister - my ""dear"" sister said the same things that she is saying, and my gut twists into a knot the size of a pea when I think about both of them talking shit about me to each other. She also said that I played the victim for all of my life (that would be my wife). How the fuck does she know?
I don't know.. but I've met evil and it comes in the form of an abusive, controlling and manipulative individual who conned me into believing that she was the one for me. Her brainwashing me into thinking that I'm a worthless piece of garbage is affecting me day in and day out. I already had overdoses and was pretty close to ending myself quite a few times. There were night when I went out and took every substance I could find so I could knock myself unconscious and die, because this world is not worth it.
No, I am not trying to play the victim. Not consciously at least. I also happen to know right from wrong, but the fact that human beings can be so selfish and downright evil is horrible.
She also would tell me to not wear pants, shoes, etc.. eat what she eats, and even breathe how she likes me to breathe. How fucking dare she.
Again, the abuse - 100000% of it - comes from her, and I never touch a hair on her head or raise my voice. i was trying to keep a vow of silence just so she wouldn't start another tantrum, but her threats started again and it became too much, so I told her that if she does anything stupid for whatever insane made up reason, I would have to take action (calling the cops, but I didn't tell her this).
I do not know what to do, I am NOT playing the victim, and I'm just thinking about how to get through this. Approximately 12 more days and she's gone, and I'm getting threats every day to not return to the house. I work from 9am-6pm writing articles 6 days a week and don't have time to just move. Work is exhausting. This ""lady"" a.k.a. demon is even more exhausting, and I'm looking for a way out. Any advice, if you're willing to give it, would be appreciated. Thank you.

I am allergic to sunlight.

But I also have depression with a seasonal pattern. 

So:

Summer = rashes, headaches, fatigue, fevers, irritability, and confusion (if I go out in the sun for a long time/forget broad spectrum sunscreen and go out basically at all between 10 and 4)

Winter = a big extra (compared to other seasons) helping of hopelessness, anhedonia, fatigue, lack of motivation, and self-loathing.

Like I was just biologically programmed to be miserable no matter the weather. You know what's really interesting about it though? People like to make fun of depression or minimize it, to act like mental health is less important or less impactful than physical health, like we should be able to ""get over it"" in a way you can't just ""get over"" physical ailments, but consider this: *I still love summer and hate winter.* 

Given the choice between living in a dark cool place where my physical body will be fine (less allergic reaction) or a sunny tropical island, I'd take the island every single time. 

So what does it really say about the impact of mental health/mood problems, when I prefer the part of the year where my skin gets covered in intensely itchy red bumps/patches, my head hurts, my temperature spikes, etc. over the part of the year where my depression gets worse?

Which I don't think i've ever done so please just bear with me, I know this is going to be long but for anyone who really takes the time to read it all and PM me or comment i do really really appreciate it, it's been a rough time for me. 

So over the past two months :
Last year, I had a solid group of best friends, we hung out all of the time. I was very comfortable with my academics and socially and with my boyfriend. Everything was great, until I started having really bad anxiety in May. At the start of september, I realized it was too much, and talked to my friends and moved into another room. They excluded me from everythin, they completely cut me out of their lives, and just seemed to so effortlessly replace me with another girl. All I ever see on facebook now is their wonderful happy pictures, and all of them just being so happy together. 


 It started at the beginning of october. My boyfriend of a year or so and I were having relationship problems and he kept canceling on things that I tried to do with/for him. I'm the type of person who is very very non-confrontational, and partially insecure, so I really didn't' want to talk to him about how much it bothered me, and I just sucked it up and said it was ok. This went on for a few weeks. The next week he told me that he missed flirting with people, so I said it was ok. I offered to have a 3 way or to have a one-sided open relationship so that he could still have his freedom, understanding that it would absolutely destroy my own feelings.

The next week, he cancelled our anniversary date. This really just got under my skin and triggered a massive panic attack (I have an anxiety disorder). I just wanted it all to stop and to get out of my head and sleep. So I half attempted suicide/wanted just peace and ended up in the hospital. I was in a psychiatric ward for a few days,  but I realized that if I couldn't get out of here, it would really mess with my academics. I lied to everyone and convinced myself it was unintentional, and got out within 24 hours. 

I went back to school, everything seemed to go back to normal for a bit, until the next week when we broke up. It seemed like it was time, we'd had problems, but it still just destroyed me, I felt like he was the only person left who I had who still cared and I was lost. I became extremely depressed for a few days, until I really started to recover. 

Note that all through this, through all of my problems and internal struggles, i've tried counseling but I just don't trust anyone. Nobody has any idea of what is going on inside my head, because I can go on lying and pretending i'm great on the outside when my head is a mess. 

Another week goes by. I decide to go out with some friends to a party. While there I meet a boy, he seems nice. We talk for a while, just about school in general and classes and other things when he asks if I wanted to go hang out somewhere else. I was so excited that he was so interested in me and that maybe I might be able to get over my ex by just talking and having this great friend. That wasn't his intention. We walked down the street for a bit before he told me we were going to his room. I refused, and he made it clear that it wasn't my choice. I was raped. 

I asked a friend a few days later, and somehow my ex found out. He has been a great support through all of this, and I have become a lot closer with a lot of other friends. I've slowly built up a new group of friends. But I just feel so lonely and lost. I feel like they don't really want me there and are just doing it out of pity. When I reach out to friends, I just never have the guts to really say why I'm doing it, I just ask as friends if they are free and if they aren't I feel like i'd be a bother to insist because I really need a friend to just talk to or hang out with. I have some good friends but I still feel like i'm taking up so much of their time and I don't ever want to take away from their lives. 

I don't know how to deal with this. I know I have a lot of trust issues, and i'm seeing a counselor regularly to deal with this, but my parents made me sign a release, and I just don't trust my counselor. In fact I dont' think I trust anyone. But for some reason it feels like a good idea to put this on the internet? 

Anyone have any ideas to help-? ",depression,t5_2qqqf,Struggling with work and friendships a lot - its been a rough semester.

Things have just been building up in my head and I've been trying to find a friend to sit down at talk with for weeks, but no one wants to listen. I don't expect anyone to read this to the end, but I just need to get this shit out of my head.

I've been dreading the coming of this weekend, because it marks one year since I last attempted, and then was brought in to the hospital. I stayed in the lockup for four days, and then stayed in the partial hospitalization program for an additional three weeks. It's been a year, but still I feel that I cannot stop thinking about the time that I spent in there. At night when I'm trying to sleep, I try hard to stop, but I can't stop reliving events that happened when I was in the hospital. I was just so incredibly alone and stripped off all my coping mechanisms that I've never been so broken at any point in my life. For four days I was forced to confront my depression every minute of every day, and the experience was just horrifying for me. I hadn't hurt myself for years before the hospital, but I started again just to be able to cope with being so completely alone.

I remember every sight, smell, every person I grew so attached to that I haven't seen since, every breakdown, every room, doctors, nurses, everything.

I remember my best friend entering my room that night and having her friend carry me into their vehicle, throwing up before I got to the car,  being rushed into the ER, but I don't remember what I was thinking or feeling before I attempted due to what I had taken - which is just scary. 

I remember the first night I got out, I couldn't sleep no matter what I took. I ended up walking out in the blistering cold at 2:30 in the morning just trying so desperately to do anything to get sleep. I took my friend up on an offer for a place to sleep at about 4am, but when I tried to sleep on his couch, I could literally hear the voice of my best friend as if she was standing over me - I heard her asking me why I did this, why I was doing this to myself. 

When I went in to the hospital, it brought an abrupt stop to college that I still haven't recovered from. I was able to fix one grade, but I still have two F's and one C- on my transcript from being in the hospital. This fall is my second semester ever (I took a semester off) and I'm just so absolutely scared that I'm going to repeat my mistakes and never be able to finish college, and that I will never go anywhere with my life.

I lost my job back in July because I was faced with the most horrible anxiety that I've ever felt in my life. I spent so many hours away from my desk locked in the bathroom on the floor losing my mind - completely detached from reality. A lot of it was thanks to the experimental high dosage my medication was increased to - I developed severe paranoia and delusions, thinking everyone at work was out to get me, and I began to hear things that weren't there. A few times I convinced myself falsely that I had forgotten to take my medication, so I took it again, causing me to overdose at work. 600mg of anything is NOT okay. I took so many medications to just get rid of my problem and be able to keep my job, which worked for over a year, but I ended up being in the worst mental and emotional condition of my life. 

Over time I counted out something like 8 different medications I've tried to take, starting at some point during my senior year of highschool, but no matter what I took, I had averse reactions. SSRIs caused me multiple different times to give up every stable thing in my life and attempt suicide. Other types of anti-depressants would cause an increase in anxiety. Benzos caused addiction, even after they caused severe memory loss. Thanks to benzos, I have a decently large chunk of my life that is gone, I just can't remember where I was or what I did. The SNRI I was given in the hospital and took for over half a year was the most addicting drug I've ever put in my body, thanks to its lightning fast half-life.

Fast forwarding to last month, I graduated therapy in a way, because my therapist told me that after I got back into college, all of my conditions improved so much. I had taken the free time between losing my job and starting college to come off of all of my horrible medications, which was the worst withdrawal experience of my life. I was just so happy to be back and I finally felt that I was making something out of my life, and I was doing it without having to give credit to any drug. 

Fast forward to today, I'm completely horrified of falling back into my footsteps of last year and wasting a whole 'nother year of my life by fucking up school. I can feel the depression coming back, and for almost no reason I just have the urge to end my life. I'm broke. I can't make rent, and as of today my bank account is into the negative. I'm applying various places, but I'm so afraid of falling back into the state of severe anxiety. I haven't paid tuition all semester, and I'm afraid that because of this I won't be able to take classes next semester. 

A few months ago, my parents left me, and shortly after that, my best friend - my one and only rock, moved across the country as well. I had been moved out of my parents house for over half a year at that point, and hadn't bothered to go back and spend any time with them until my dog began to pass away. This was due to a lot of relationship problems between me and them - I had a really shitty childhood and teenage years in that house, with a lot of experiences of verbal abuse, neglect, and a couple instances of physical abuse. I didn't expect them to stay around the state just to be ignored by me anyway, but I am still just upset that while everyone I know is still living with their parents and fully supported by them, mine are across the country and I'm all on my own. Tomorrow, my father is having surgery, and I'm horrified of the idea of possibly losing him before I have the chance to amend the problems we've had over the years. 

I just don't know what to do. As soon as I saw the test results from my therapist showing that I had improved, I KNEW things wouldn't stay that way, that I'd just fall down in this hole again and struggle to get out. I didn't really even acknowledge the improvement. I just don't want to be alone at night, get drunk and try to commit again. I'm so scared of going back to the hospital, and I'm so scared of fucking up my grades. I'm so scared that this is the end.

I don't want to follow the path that my friends have. The first friend I ever had as a child committed suicide, less than a year after a close friend of mine was taken over by his disease and committed suicide as well. I know damn well what it does to a family, friends, and a community, but I just can't shake this horrible low I'm feeling. No one around me seems to give a fuck about me anymore, because no matter who I contact to hang out I'm still left sitting alone at home with my thoughts. I feel like I've been surrounded by death and so many horrible relationships.

I don't know what to do to get this shit out of my head. I just want to get through this semester, and return next semester, and keep my life on track. I just want money. I want to be emotionally stable, and I want the full motivation to get there. ",depression,t5_2qqqf,"I don't have anyone to talk to, but I just need to vent."

My fiancée has been spending less and less time with me, at her female friends house most nights getting drunk. I already know they all have their tits out (including hers) and I can't complain about it because A: they aren't fucking (even though just last night she called me drunk saying her and her female friend were gonna fuck, I was silent because we are fucking ENGAGED and then she said ""just kidding baby haha""), and B: there's 3 other girls there who pop their tits out. I wouldn't ever be able to see her friend's tits because she wouldn't like that. Cuz I'm a guy. But it's somehow justified that she sees her friends' tits and if I get any sort of offended, she won't understand. She'll justify it by saying she's a girl, and those are her friends. 

Another reason I'm sad/depressed(?): I have close to no friends. When she's out getting drunk and taking her tits out in front of her friends, I'm sitting at home smoking weed, getting couch lock, and playing video games or crying over how lonely I am while watching Netflix.

Another reason I'm sad/depressed(?): I work a shit job at a gas station and I've been Brett for three years just to earn a dollar promotion to $10/hr. Just to have my state vote to change minimum wage to $9.75/hr. I wasted three years here just to go back to making minimum wage with customers who don't respect me all while I force myself to smile and tell them to have a good day.

Another reason I'm sad/depressed(?): I'm taking supplement pills to help me lose weight. While they seem to be working (I'm losing half a pound to a pound a day), I feel like they're also what's making me feel so depressed. The pills are called Zantrex Black if that even matters.

I've started to feel so sad I consider suicide at least 5 times a day, but I know I'm too much of a fucking pussy to do anything about it or actually go through with it.

Am I depressed? Or just extremely sad? Should I stop taking the pills? Should I just end it all? I don't really see a point to living anymore to be completely honest...

These days have been horrible - I got home a few days ago and was instantly called crazy, and I finally lost it and told her to shut up or I call the cops. Then she got internet buddies of hers to send me hateful emails. I retaliated in kind through emails - it was way too much pressure and I lost my cool. By losing my cool I mean standing up to her and sternly telling her to shut up. That's it. From a distance of a few metres away. I locked myself in the room afterwards. It's been 3 days of her insults, and I had a few breakdowns - took way too much clonazepam on one of those, but just fell asleep and woke up very late, only to sleep again. She's flying to the UK on the 27th. It's been over 1 year where I felt emotionally abused and stepped on, and was treated like garbage. And yeah, I still do love her, but I know that she is evil and is just out to cause damage. I would never ever hurt her though - it's not in my nature. What I did do is put a mirror in front of her through emails, so she could see who she is and the damage she caused, preying on the emotionally vulnerable. I was in my room and she was in hers. 

Now she found a lawyer for the divorce, and wants me to pay for it, which I won't because I must find another place to live. She'll most likely pay for it herself, but even if she does, I fear a massive breakdown in or before signing that piece of paper. Any advice would be welcome.

I feel like a want to get something off my chest, maybe get some advice.

I have struggled with depression and anxiety (dysthymia?) for many years. I'm only just really coming to terms with that. Throughout highschool I had a pretty troubled and fucked up home life, that persisted for 5~ years, and it got to the point where, for me, feeling miserable, angry, and dead inside was the norm.

I've been living with my SO for the past year, which has been great, but I've also been struggling with major chronic depression due to a couple of things (we had an abusive borderline psychopathic housemate who basically destroyed me psychologically and emotionally and I'm still not over it, even though we kicked him out a year ago). I've been taking anti-depressants for about half a year and they have helped with panic attacks and intrusive thoughts but I still often have dysthymia. I'm unemployed, very poor, I've never had a job and no matter what I try I am unable to find one. My girlfriend is only a year older but has a successful bank programmer job and is doing fantastically. I feel so inferior to her, like I'm nowhere near good enough for her. I feel lazy and cowardly and boring compared. I never learnt a very good work ethic and because her hand has been injured for some time I'm tasked with doing basic cleaning jobs which even those I have difficultly handling. She has started to support me financially because my student welfare payments have been cut (she makes too much money). I love her with all my heart, she's intent of having a very long relationship and getting a house together, but no matter what I can't break the feeling that it's just a matter of time until she inevitably breaks up with me because she's tired of dating a failure. :( 

I got carried away there, so I'll get down to what I actually wanted to say:

I feel lost. I'm just a month or so away from hopefully finishing my degree (game art and design). I struggle to feel motivated about it. I struggle to feel motivated about anything. I'm at home basically 24/7 and I struggle day to day to feel like the day is meaningful. It ends up feeling that I'm just ticking numbers off a mental calender. I wake up, dick around on my computer for hours feeling empty, wait for my girlfriend to get home and then we go to sleep. Sometimes I wake up and wonder why I'm still waking up in the first place when everything is just the same day over and over and over again.

To cope with my depression initially I started investing into fish tanks. I'm a massive animal lover and I love having pets; having an aquarium was great and filled my days. Now I'm getting lackluster over it. It doesn't seem to fill the hole that it used to.

I usually spend my days on reddit, and maybe play a game to pass the time. I feel like something huge is just beyond my grasp, some part of me that is so excited to break out and devote myself to a project again, like I used to. But I feel like it's always out of my reach. I've been having kind of.... hypomanic episodes recently, where I feel an insane urge of productivity and creativity but have no way of directing it, no goal or hobby to devote it. I feel like there's a massive obvious thing just out of reach that would fill the hole I feel, but I don't know what it is. Is it religion? Is it a job? Is it self esteem? Weed? Alcohol? Is it some kind of creative project? I feel it sometimes, that explosion of interest and creativity in something, and it makes me feel so happy and fulfilled. But lately that feeling has just vanished and I don't know how to make it come back.

I want it so badly but at the same time, going through the endless day to day routine is so easy. I feel like I'm starting to slip back into a borderline eating disorder, I'm becoming obsessed with my weight and have started neglecting eating proper meals and instead just drinking weight loss shakes.

I don't really know what I'm searching for. I guess I want to ask; when you lost interest in living a creative, productive life, when you began to slip into just 'existing' because of depression... what did you focus your interests on to give yourself a spark? What hobby or interest did you decide to take up that you could devote yourself to? Did you start meditating? Did you fill the hole with material goods? Did you start cooking, or painting? What made it worthwhile to get up that day?

Sorry that this is long

I have posted unanonamously on r/suicidewatch several times before, as well as on r/depression; feeling helpless and alone and wanting to die.

I've wondered if I had some kind of mood disorder other than depression for a while. My depression comes in very short waves, with what I would classify as ""episodes"" (or the peaks, I dunno) lasting anywhere from half an hour to two hours. I cry, I spill my guts to anyone who will listen, and just generally hate myself. I can't find a description of any mental illness matching such short outbursts. Bipolar episodes are supposed to last weeks, and until now I've just brushed it off and stuck to thinking of myself as depressed because manic episodes were missing. But tonight...

So I had what some would call a bad day at work. Super busy, something really shitty happened, and I got really pissed off. But after a while (maybe 15 minutes, maybe more, maybe less, I don't really trust my perception of time right now) it was like the dial came back around and I just started acting like I was happy and ridiculously calm. Nothing could faze me. Not customers coming in five minutes before close, not even the thing that made me so angry to begin with. I had these violent fantasies in the back of my mind, but I let them run around unchecked in the background while I acted normal.

I ended up staying half an hour longer than I should have, but I just thought, ""oh well, it's only time. If they get mad I can quit and/or kill myself."" I finished my job as best I could. I made some irrational decisions, like I took my jacket off and went outside to take out the trash, lock some stuff up, etc. in a polo even though it's only 25F out.

Then when I got home I scooped out my cats' litter box even though it didn't really need it and I cleaned up the kitchen. Not spotless, but I picked up the dishes and some trash that got left on the counter. While all of this was happening I still felt calm, but I didn't really feel in control of my actions.

All told it has been about an hour and a half since it started. Now I'm laying in bed and calming down.

I wish I could indulge in it frequently.  I find it very comforting and soothing.  Second, I am also a pedophile attracted to girls as young as three.  I served over six years in prison on child porn charges, and am on probation for the rest of my life.  One of the conditions of my probation is mandatory sex offender treatment.

I have been working on my social skills (as i am somewhat lacking in them), and also my anxiety problems.

I am truly afraid of what will happen to me when I can’t sever my AB/DL urges from myself.

I'm tired of feeling absolutely nothing with regard to anything at all, and that I'm not even living, rather existing.

I feel as though I don't have a right to feel the way I do. I'm a student at a really good university, I have supportive parents, and the most amazing girlfriend anyone could ask for. On the face of it, I have it all. And yet I feel dissatisfied with everything, except for my girlfriend.

Problem is, though she's been a rock for me, I can't help but feel like I'm constantly burdening her with this. She could do better than me, I know that. She deserves better than me.

It's got to the point where I'm struggling to go into university now. It's my first year and my attendance is already shocking because of the amount I've missed. I feel drained and exhausted in the mornings and find it impossible to drag myself out of bed. It takes up all my energy when I do, and therefore it's impossible to do my work at university. I guess when you're faced with images in the mornings of the various ways in which I could kill myself I'm not going to want to face the day in front of me.

I used to be the most confident person in the world, and this has reduced me to basically nothing. I can't do anything anymore. I can't make anyone happy. I can't even go outside and talk to people. I need help. I've tried CBT, counselling, medication, none of it to any effect.

I'm not entirely sure why I'm posting here. Maybe to get it off my chest. Something along those lines. To anyone who has sat through and read that, thank you.",depression,t5_2qqqf,Life is just one flat line.

No, not even my parents. They love me, they're happy to have me, I'm sure they wouldn't go back and get an abortion or whatever, but realistically I can look at their situation and say that their lives would have probably been easier, freer, and a lot more fun if they'd never had me. I even think that they might not be sick now (each with their own problems) because they wouldn't have had so much stress and they could have afforded preventative medical care. 

I asked my husband if I had made his life better. He said he couldn't rationally say that I had because he doesn't know what would have happened if we weren't together. So... no. 

I moved out of my home country and all my friends have probably forgotten about me. My coworkers don't hate me, but I wonder if they'd even notice if I were suddenly replaced with someone else. I'm almost certain my students wouldn't care. (I'm a subject teacher, I see 600+ students a week. 99% sure most of them don't even remember my name.)

I've never felt comfortable talking to my parents because they never made me feel like I could trust them. They're the most judgemental people I know and they always talk bad stuff about my sister who is bi polar. I'm supposed to think they don't talk about me? HAH. Right.
It took me five years to finally get help. And even then I didn't tell them directly, I told my favorite teacher. I told her how I was bullied and felt sad all the time and even thought of suicide. I'd never dream of telling my parents that. How could i? That was 2 weeks ago.
And tonight I had work, 10-7. I rode my bike in the snow (I don't drive yet) and told my parents I'd ride back home because I was going to do some Christmas shopping. Well, my mom said she'd pick me up, which is nice of her.
Today was shipment day and we were packed. Usually shipment days are tuesdays but because of thanksgiving they came in today. I worked cashier and in departments to help people stock. Then when I was done with that I helped another person- let's call her c. C is a really nice person who, if not for her, I probably wouldn't be here for 8 months. She's helped me come out of my shell a bit and has taught me al the things I need to know. 
The store and so many boxes, they still haven't even finished recovering. We close at 8 but I was leaving at 7. It was going to be a long night, a manager guessed they'd be there until midnight and I could tell c was tired so I offered to get her starbucks from next door. I told my mom I'd be out about 5 minutes late because I wanted to help someone. I got her starbucks and left. It literally took me 5 minutes and my mom was pissed
I just don't get it, I just want to be nice to people but my mom lectures me instead. About what?! I said I'd ride my bike home, no biggie. I like nighttime riding anyways. If she was told she had to stay 4 hours overtime for work, wouldn't she want some extra energy? Just a favor?  I apologized to her and all, saying I was just trying to be nice.
Sometimes I think that if I were old enough to live alone, then maybe I wouldn't feel like crap most of the time. Instead I live in a house where, God-forbid, you do favors for nice people.
I see why my older sister moved out. What's funny is she seems happier now. When she needed help, my parents kicked her out because they thought she was doing drugs. I know my sister. She doesn't do that. And she didnt. Then they wondered why she never came to visit. When she moved out I never really had anyone to talk to so I stayed in my room most of the time because I was lonely. They blamed her for moving out that she never came to visit. My sister and I are close, she's like my best friend. I feel bad, I never wanted her to be blamed. But THEY don't talk to me. I'd love to see my sister more, but if I were her I'd never come back either. They are my parents, they are supposed to be there for my sister, not kick her out wjen she needs help. Thankfully she's been seeing a doctor and is on meds and is doing way better since being away from my parents.

I've never felt like I had an identity or a culture that I could be a part of. I have had this issue my whole life and now as an adult I feel adrift and empty. I want to move to another part of the country but starting a new job means I'm stuck in a cold, monolithic, dull city for a year at least. 


I feel trapped in my situation and like I'll never find a place I can call home or be able to do the things I wanted to do with my life. Cost is always an issue. Culture and upbringing have also been an issue for me. I am a first generation in the US or however the breakdown goes and I feel like I've gotten the worst of both worlds. I'm twice a reject and everywhere I go I am playing along to get along and dealing with ethos that I don't even believe in. 


My life is a fraud and I can't find a short term salve while I try to figure a way out. I live well below my means so financial independence will be something I can gain before I'm too old to enjoy life. But the result is I live in a cramped space, spend all my time on work or finances and I'm in a profession that I hate. 


My doctors are quick to recommend therapy or drugs but I feel like there's no cure for the problems I deal with. There's no where in this world where my upbringing or POV would be the norm. There's no subculture i can find a home in. There's no one I can feel close to. And I have to choose between hating technical subjects or dealing with not being able to support myself or a family if I someday have one. I feel like I'm stuck in a world that I don't belong in, in a time period I can't make any sense of other than to pretend to be OK with it. 


I'm tired of interacting with my coworkers, housemates and family. I hate and resent them that they get to benefit from social bullshit and this fake face I have to maintain for them. Meanwhile nobody ever makes themselves uncomfortable for my sake. My family is useless and has completely broken up over the years. Even my fucking housemates can't follow simple instructions and are convinced that they are my ""friends"" and that they could ever mean anything to me other than to be an interchangeable pair of people I deal with to reduce housing expenses. I hate suffering through every day, knowing nothing I do will ever matter beyond my old comfort, anyway. 


I'm being pressured to pursue counseling but I feel like what are we going to discuss when I get there? At this point I just want to find a numbing agent that doesn't completely compromise my mental abilities so I can deal with it all and get out of here somehow. I don't understand how a social worker will even begin to understand my cultural AND social AND personal problems. They don't know anything beyond the manual and how to pump out SSRIs. 


I don't know if there's any resource in this world that can help me. Maybe the numbing would be better than being fed up and exhausted all the time. ",depression,t5_2qqqf,Feel like medication won't help because I know why I'm depressed and nothing can be done about it.

I still get knocked back into my depression, and the usual cause is dreams. For example, last night I dreamed I was back with a girl I truly loved. Waking up, I remembered that it's over. These dreams keep me from moving on. I dream I'm young again, in a different place, a different kind of person.

My dream self is usually such an assertive, strong, competent person. I wake up in the same bed with the same life I've always had. My dreams break the chains of reality, yet each time my alarm rings, I am back in them.

I just got home from hospital. I was there for suicide attempt. 

*Maybe I should give you all some background:
I'm a 15 year old female. I am diagnosed with depression, anxiety and a binge eating disorder. I've had the two first for about 7-8 years, that's my psychiatrists are saying anyway. I have intense intrusive thoughts, and it is believed that I may have some form of OCD. I've selfharmed for about a year. I have attempted suicide before (last year). I attempted this year, a couple of times. After the most recent one, stuff happened and I got sent to hospital. Two weeks. I just got back home.*

This stay at the hospital was quite intense. I saw a psychiatrist once every three days. Rest of the time, I stayed in my room mostly. I felt like I was going to have a mental breakdown, like my sanity was flaking away piece by piece. (Later, psychiatrists concluded I was going through a major depressive episode.) I talked to the staff about this and their solution was to have me on 24-hour watch (have a nurse watch me 24 hours a day, nights included.)

I ended up breaking down. Friday of the first week, I had a total breakdown. The mental pain I was going through was so intense that I could not move my limbs. I collapsed and had to breathe manually. This was while I was in the bathroom, washing my face. The nurse was outside. After about 10mins, he started getting worried. He called out my name, and as I didn't answer, he got another nurse who unlocked the door,  and there I was. The nurse helped me to my bed, and sat there with me. They got an emergency psychiatrist for me. It was rather chaotic, apparently. I was totally out of it, though.  The psychiatrist talked to me a while, I just nodded my head. I couldn't hear a word he said: my brain was just not functioning. I couldn't do anything. The mental pain was too brutal and intense. The psychiatrist obviously noticed that. They got me some pills and put me in my bed. I must have fallen asleep. I woke up with a headache and eyes filled with tears. I had some breakfast. I slept some more. Couldn't think. 

They ended up putting me on 10 min checks (nurse checks on me every 10minutes) instead of 24 hour watch, because I couldn't handle having someone around me all the time. 

They have increased my medications, and my psychiatrist found a psychologist I'll be seeing every week for a year or so. The hospital didn't help me much. I almost never saw any people that worked with mental health. All the staff there was educated in health, but physical. They couldn't help me when I was breaking down, didn't know what to say to comfort me, didn't know what to say when I selfharmed, didn't know what to do when I opened up and asked them to help me. They were lost. I was locked in my room with someone who was supposed to help me, but had no idea what they were doing. It didn't help me. It fucked with my mind. 

I just needed to get that off my chest. 

I'll be seeing the psychologist. I'll be taking the meds. I'll give it a shot, I really will. But I don't think they will help me. I am far too fucked up. 

Thanks for listening to my rant.",depression,t5_2qqqf,"Got back from hospital, I just need someone to talk to"

I was exposed to extremely sexual behavior as a child, and was asked to recount it to my psychiatrist. ""Do you think about it?"" ""Sometimes,"" I said. Sometimes I'd get upset over it when I got frustrated about my sexuality (since it was a girl who did it, i feel like that's why i struggle with my sexuality) but it doesn't bother me as much. ""Has anything else bad happened to you?"" He asked.

This is where I fell quiet. The anxiety kicked in and I told him I didn't feel comfortable saying it while my mom was in the room. ""Your mom isn't leaving,"" he said, ""you need to learn how to communicate with her."" (?) I was ready to hyperventilate.


I had to recount the thing that I had been working hard on forgetting. I even went as far as to repeatedly tell myself something else happened in hopes that I'd believe it. I had to open it up all over again, and in front of my mother. I was so ashamed. I explained to him how I had met a 17 year old girl over the internet when I was thirteen who would basically coerce and guilt me into doing sexual favors for all of her male friends. She was very delusional and thought of herself as my savior. She exploited and used me. The friendship went on and off for about three years, until I started talking to her for the last time. She did something really, really terrible to me that i'll maybe elaborate on in a different post if anyone is interested. But to save time, this bothered me more than my sexual abuse as a child. This would send me into random panic and crying attacks, but I had been doing so well coping with it. After I finished, he LAUGHED (yes, laughed) and said, ""The internet is a big world. I suggest you get friends that you can see face to face."" 

I feel like I brought it up for nothing and I feel like he diagnosed me with PTSD over what happened to me as a child instead of this. And now I've been reliving what happened ever since I had to explained it and have it brushed aside. Every time something reminds me of it now I start crying, no matter where I am or who I'm around.

I'm way overweight. I'm 18, 6'2"" and 286 pounds as of this morning. I go online and see alot of people saying I should look a certain way or I will be pretty much hated. I know I'm overweight, and honestly I've done fuck all about it. 

I get depressed and I eat, alot. When I get depressed, or anxious, I have this feeling of emptiness and I try to solve it with food. It helps a little to be honest, but it also just ensures that I'm going to feel bad about myself the next time I step on the scale. 

I've considered starving myself. For the past few days I've become more and more unhappy with how I look, and starving myself to lose weight seems like a viable option. Maybe just drink liquids, not eat.

I don't exercise, it just never pops up in my mind unless someone says something about it and before even thinking, I just say I feel great.

My friends and family tell me I don't need to lose weight, but I need to more than anything. I feel like if I don't start losing weight, that I'm going to be a failure at other things I'd like to do with my life.

My stomach hangs over my belt buckle unless I tuck my shirt in. 
I've been a lot bigger. I was at my biggest at age 12. I weighed 280, and I was around 5'6"".

I just need someone to work with me to make this easier. I don't want someone to tell me I look great unless they mean it. I just want to stop feeling so damn shitty about myself. 

I've tried working out before.. Some friends and I were going to go do ""the steps"" (its a thousand steps up), but they would always go without me. 

I don't even feel comfortable in anything but jeans and hoodie. I can't bring myself to work out in public, because I used to, and I was relentlessly picked on for it.

I'm in a committed relationship with a very loving and caring girlfriend. We have been dating for a few months now and everything is fantastic. We rarely fight or argue and when we do we solve the problem fairly quickly. 

However, I have my own set of issues I deal with. I stress easily and have a lot of anxiety. I love my girlfriend very much and when you love someone their happiness becomes yours. Due to this I am often finding myself worrying about her. I want her to be happy but due to BPD she can be sort of back and forth (choosing my words carefully here). 

For instance sometimes she will be down in the dumps and I will cheer her up, but by the time she's cheered up and happy I feel shitty. And then her cheeriness just irritates me. I don't want to start subconsciously resenting her for this. It started to happen once recently but I guess I sort of snapped out of it.

I am also scared that I haven't seen the worst of it yet. By that I mean the things I read that could directly effect me (emotional abuse, manipulation, etc.). I don't want to end up hurt by her, which causes me to keep my guard up. This does not help with my trust issues I already have. She has not given me any reason not to trust her but it's hard sometimes. Sometimes I wonder if I'm already being manipulated and I'm just not realizing it. Its happened many times before with past relationships and I never saw it until after things ended.

She also plays victim sometimes. She will accuse me of doing something that she's clearly doing or causing. Sometimes they're things that I'm not even upset about. 

She has also kind of admitted that she likes attention which scares me.

I think the worst part of it all is that she refuses to seek help. Real help. Her BPD is due to trauma from earlier years (I'm assuming). As her boyfriend I always want her to be happy, and like that saying goes ""how am I supposed to make you happy if you can't make yourself happy."" She continues to face these issues from BPD and she isn't going to get anywhere with it if she continues this. And anytime I recommend or even sound like I'm insinuating that talking to someone would help she flips her lid on me and gets pissed off at me. She has told me several times to never ever suggest it to her again because it pisses her off. I did it anyway for a little while because one would think that the persistence would show that I care, because I do. But it never ended well and the last time I did it started one of our bigger fights. 

Overall our relationship is great though. She makes me happy and she's the best girl I've ever dated. I just need some advice on how to deal with these things. Thank you in advance.

EDIT: If your advice is to talk to her about it then I need suggestions on how to approach her with it. She's very sensitive and I don't want her to think I'm thinking about leaving her (bad abandonment issues) or something like that. Plus I hate upsetting her or seeing her cry.

**EDIT 2: Okay I'm just going to be straight up honest. I've been speaking with the fear that she would read this. I don't think she gets on this sub but who knows. I'm scared that if I don't leave her she's going to leave me. And I mean that I'm afraid she will abruptly leave me for someone else. She basically left her ex boyfriend of a long time for me. It went a healthy relationship by any means, but she still did it. I never considered the possibility of her being about to do that to someone who is good to her (me) until lately. I'm scared everyone. Can you all just be honest with me about what I should do. I really done want to get hurt.**",BPD,t5_2qqdp,My girlfriend has BPD. Need some tips/help/advice.

For me, being in college means i can pretty much get up when i want and do what i want. Which, on one hand means i don't have to stress about commitments that i will have to make excuses for but on the other hand, lack of daily structure has it's drawbacks.

So the point is that it's 9.37am at night, meaning i haven't slept yet, but could have potentially gone to bed at 3-4am, which would have been sufficient.

The thing is how sleep deprivation finally frees me from having all this incessant mind-chatter that makes me want to double over and clutch my insides. Sleep is good, but to be able to be conscious but not thinking feels great, to be so tired that you can't even think.

So this is of cause the same reason people take drugs in order to elevate the symptoms of depression so i would not class this as healthy behaviour.

I have had trouble sleeping for years but this is the first time i have made a connection between how the tiredness makes me feel less anxiety, half-asleep but still awake. It's like i wish this feeling could last all the time, this numbness of not feeling bad, but this can't be good can it.

I suppose we grasp at whatever we can to alleviate the pain, some turn to substance abuse as i mentioned, but strange how the brain may turn to more unorthodox methods if it is not given an outlet or a respite from the constant thinking.

Since then, I've been talking to my father who I live with, and trying to tell him that I need help. 

The first week, I tried to commit suicide but didn't. I looked to family and friends of help and support, but I suppose my attitude drove them away.

The overwhelming support was wonderful. i feel lucky to have such a great support system here with such a sensitive topic. Especially since not many people I know in real life know about it. Anyways, I have took some time to gather my thoughts and write down exactly why I feel so much anxiety, stress, and worry. I need your advice again and this time its more specific as opposed to my last post which was written during an emotional time for me and had a lot of venting and frustration added into it. 

Due to the fact I love my girlfriend and I want make it work, I have been researching BPD more and more. I have read horror stories on guys getting left abruptly and for another guy. Its scary because thats what she did to her ex boyfriend. He was very abusive emotionally and even slapped her and pushed her around a few times (all of this is confirmed, I know its true because I have seen it and so have others). She was with him for a year and a half. She tells me now that she knew THREE months in that she didn't truly love him. Yet she showed him praise on social media, told him she loved him, had hopeful talks about the future, marriage, etc. The same thing she does with me now. And during the last few months with her ex she was definitely interested in me, she admits it. Her ex always suspected it. And I was interested in her. But she never cheated on him physically. Only emotionally if you count me consoling her through the break up and right before as emotional cheating.

The difference between me and her last boyfriend is I'm a good guy. I'm basically the total opposite of her last boyfriend in terms of the bad things he did. I'm very caring, supportive, understanding, and patient. Not just in terms of her BPD, with everything. 

We've been together for almost five months now. And I'm starting to get scared. My trust issues combined with hearing these consistent stories and having watched her do that to her last, is giving me the most anxiety I've ever felt. Its even made me insecure. Every time I hear a guy complimented her or pretty much anything pertaining to her and another male that is of any potential threat, I get anxiety. It brings me down and it makes me paranoid. Its starting to effect my mood and in turn how I am when I'm talking to her. When my anxiety is bad its hard to see that sweet girl I love, I almost feel like I'm looking at my impending doom. But she hasn't given me any reason not to trust her, so I should just breathe and realize I'm being crazy right? Its not that easy. I don't know what to do. Its gotten so bad at one point I have thought about just breaking up and ending it all, but then I realize I'm being crazy. I don't want to use a permeant solution for a temporary problem.

So I ask, what should I do now? Should I talk to her? I thought maybe telling her pretty much everything I just wrote. But I don't want her to freak out and think I'm about to leave her (she's got abandonment issues, but obviously I'd leave out the thought about breaking up part). But then if I talk to her, then what? I don't want her to start thinking she needs to not discuss or talk about any interaction she's had with other males to keep me sane. I don't want this to backfire on me. Also, if I should talk to her, I need some pointers on how to make this easy on her. Also how I should word/approach it? I want this to be a peaceful and strengthening thing. I don't want her to think we have issues (notice how worried I am about trying to keep things good in her eyes so she doesn't stray away).

Thanks in advance and sorry this is so much. I don't expect a big response from everyone. This is such a unique situation so I figured I should give all context. Some of you recommended some good books in my last post. I will look into those, right now I don't have time to read a book to solve this. This is an urgent issue and I need to get out of this anxiety-filled mind set. Thank you all again.

EDIT: Also, if I do talk to her about this, its very possible she will feel attacked. She might also pull the ""you don't trust me"" card which is understandable. I trust her, its just very hard to ignore all of these things I've read combined with my personal experiences with her. She might also feel victimized or hurt. How should I handle that if it happens?",BPD,t5_2qqdp,[Update] My girlfriend has BPD. Need some tips/help/advice.

I'm sure it makes me the worst person in the world, but I've sort of been looking forward to that part of life. 

Been on my own for a long time, previous exes were violent (kept trying to make it work even after he broke my arm) and the last ""date"" I had was years ago and ended when he said he expected to be paid to spend time with me. 

I work long hours to try to make ends meet, so even when I've got time to go out, I'm too tired and can't afford it. OKCupid and PlentyOfFish were similar - both totally useless. Nobody replied to messages, never received anything that wasn't a scam. 

In an ideal world, I'd just find a decent plastic surgeon and get everything changed - fantasise about how I could make this happen, but it never comes to anything. 

Tried working on personality instead but the only thing anyone ever wants is ""NOT CRAZY LOL"" which when you're trying to get through each day with a mental illness is the last thing you want to hear - this thing that makes your life hell also makes people hate you. 

Tried finding people with similar interests and made some cool acquaintances (I don't have ""friends"" - I'm too poor for that) but they're just people I talk to online and none of them seem to be single. 

Taking up cool new hobbies is a fabulous idea until you come back to being poor and working 12 hours a day. 

But my one BIG problem that always drives me straight into a downward spiral is this idea that I'm going to be alone for the rest of my life. I just can't see how this is ever going to change and having thought about it a LOT, I'm not sure I want to carry on living like that. 

I know it's stupid and it's shallow and it's wrong and bad and horrible, but I don't feel like I have a real life - it's empty. It's not what I wanted. 

But when you look for answers on ""how to be happy"" it just tells you that ""ONLY YOU CAN MAKE YOURSELF HAPPY!!!"" Except I can't. I can't be happy when I'm alone and that sort of needs another person. I feel like I've tried everything I can sensibly do (talking to people online, dating sites, I'm still too poor to go out, not appropriate to meet people at work...) so what now? 

""Just wait"" isn't an option any more. I've been ""Just wait""ing for years and feel like I'm getting further away. I just wish I knew IF there was ever going to be anyone else - if there isn't, I'd rather go now. I feel like I could never offer anyone anything because all they want is ""Not crazy"" so short of finding a cure for BPD, that's not going to happen. I live with it well enough to work, but that's not good enough. Feel like I'll never be ""clean"" of the ""crazy"" label. 

The only other answer I ever get is ""you don't NEED another person to be happy!!!"" except I do. I was happy in an abusive relationship because at least he was there sometimes. I would have put up with it forever - he left. 

Too poor for pets, too undatable to ever find anyone - it just feels like life wasn't for me and I'd be better off out of it.

But all the things I have ever aspired to be, at various points in my life, I will never become. Airline pilot? Nope. High-level political office? Fat chance. Astronaut? Snowflake's chance in hell. Thanks to FAS, adhd, schizo, and depression, delayed development, and abnormally early puberty.

Now while my adopted family was decent, I still feel like my upbringing was shitty as hell. I'm now 30, and my age is hitting me *hard*. My youth has been completely wasted, and while I share some of the blame for bad choices, it's not my fault God is a sadistic bastard. My elementary school was corrupt, like most of them are. But while I had a decent childhood in Suburbia, it was cruelly torn away when we moved to a shitty ultra conservative tea party town in middle school. It didn't help that by then, I already knew the difference between suburbia and small towns, in terms of sex and relationships: Semi-city suburbia = single girls galore; small shit republican town = [in the desert. alone.](http://i.imgur.com/zaF8pfw.jpg), with the girls ultra-prudish and sexphobic to boot.

Just thinking about it makes me want to punch holes in my wall. And the one big life dream I had was to be married with someone and at least 8 kids total when all is said and done. Nope. Ideally, I should have found someone in HS or shortly thereafter, and settled, even though in reality, I was lazy, deadbeat, and preferred computer games. Now, I'm stuck flipping burgers for the rest of my life. 30 years old; still never had a first real kiss, no first fuck, no nothing.

It didn't help that eight years ago, I joined my family on a vacation abroad. The only time I ever left the US. The vacation was nice, but coming back somehow sparked a butterfly effect in my brain; and triggered a downward spiral in my already pre-existing depression; resulting in increasingly worse hygiene and such; culminating in a total mental breakdown that sparked my current life situation. Stuck in a group home for years on end and a stereotypical fast food job, with no hope of any improvement of any sort. And to make things worse, my extremely hostile attitude I have towards my biomom, who I have never met, I have repeatedly projected my negative perception of her onto my adoptive mom, and the lady who runs the gh, causing tense friction, and I only realized this relatively recently.

And although I'm in yet another different town, it's still a shitty town that opposes all my beliefs and values, regardless of how overactive my libedo is or was or whatever. And **speaking of which**, my therapist has brought up the idea that in some way, I'm being unfair to myself, when I look up naughty stuff online. And I suspect there is some truth to it; I frequently find myself depressed just by even *looking* at it; because it makes me think I'm somehow missing out on ""fun"" when really reality is anything but, not to mention it makes me think of a life I wish I had but never did.

And the reason I brought up God at the start is because of my beliefs. As an intellectual, with a higher than average IQ despite some bitch being selfish, I guess it'd be expected of me to believe not. But considering my experiences and the things I've learned, I find it hard not to. Seeing a post about determinism on here earlier tonight brought back old feelings; from when I obsessively googled site after site of ancient-aliens-type stuff, resulting in pseudo-science being tied into my belief system. Being a huge astrology hobbyist was a huge factor, because since my paternal grandparents were huge astrology people themselves (which is why my mom got along so well with them, since she is clairvoyant), I learned much of it from them. And so, a lot of times, I feel like I have absolutely no control over my life, and that freedom of choice, and even freedom itself, is nothing more than a psychological illusion. So not only do my negative feelings and eternal anger towards bio-mom get projected upon my mom and gh provider, they get projected not just onto the Lord Almighty, but the Universe itself. 

And being a trekkie, the planet Earth feels like a prison, more than anything. So I don't know how kind or benign you think the esoteric side of life is, but I seriously believe *someone* up there has it in for me.",depression,t5_2qqqf,"My life is ruined. Thanks a lot, God."

However ive been recently diagnosed with aspergers and ocd. Ive just had enough with life because no matter how hard i try and how much dedication i put towards it, nothing ever goes well.

First off, i cant go back to college because im disqualified for fafsa due to poor gpa, and my grandparents wont help me out with college (even though they are wealthy) and try to make every excuse to not help me out because my mother was the adopted one in the family and my grandparents are holding a grudge that she had me and my siblings at a young age.

Second, i cant find a job, and the ones i do find are fucking shitty and dont pay enough at all. partially it has to do with the economy, but it also has to do with companies not wanting to deal with people with mental disabilities no matter how minor. and before you say anything, yes i do believe that is the case because the majority of the greedy ass fucking corporations out there they want the best of the best, and they feel as disabled people are inferior. oh im sorry, last time i checked were not in Nazi Germany, because Hitler put special needs people in camps.

Third, i don't want to talk to my family because its highly dysfunctional and i cant take their bullshit. my mother is sick from cancer, and of course her parents wont help her out, my step dad refuses to get his lazy ass a job, let alone quit doing meth. and my biological father (who was never around) is a dead beat drunk, womanizing, fat piece of shit.

Fourth, i feel alienated by people. I hardly talk to anyone except a select few people. Most of my friends are busy with their own lives and don't have time to hang out anymore. I've become an introvert because i absolutely despise people. Because I've been alienated even as a kid with my disabilities. Back when i was little, i felt that way because of the fact that i was more intelligent than people who had severe disabilities, but too socially awkward for quote on quote ""NORMAL PEOPLE!"".

I honestly see no point of going back to college, because no one will hire me for a job anyway, i cant drive because no one will teach me, ive been kicked out of my old roommates apartment because she was tired of dealing with my disability because i tend to be forgetful, ive been financially abused by my parents before they kick me the fuck out, i haven't had a girlfriend in years, and i lost my passion for music because it was something i love doing when ever i record.

It seems like all i ever want to do is lay in bed and be on my laptop, weather it be going on Reddit, YouTube, or other stupid shit on the internet. and if not that i usually listen to music when im angry.

I'm on the verge of killing myself, because i don't serve any other purpose than to be treated like a fool, nobody would fucking care any way, i certainly don't give a shit about the people that are around my life anymore, because of how little they give me motivation, or how little they make me feel valued. 

Im a genuinely nice person that works hard and always do the right thing, but what do i get in return, nothing. I want to ask why should i even continue even living. im 21 years old and i already feel like my life is coming to an end.

Not only do I have dissociative episodes, but the people that come out and share this headspace with me seem to be based on characters that already exist. It's weird because it's seemingly random who will come from what, and does not depend on how involved with the show or the character I am. 

They understand that it's not them whenever we scroll by stuff like fanart, but they feel like they've had past lives associated with their fiction. Since they've showed up, It's been a little easier getting things done. before, I was unable to leave my room because of fear and anxiety. now I can freely walk downstairs and provide food for me and my boyfriend that can be made without the microwave ( I mean, our stuff was broken for a very long time so it was kind of impossible before anyways...but still!) If I, myself can't do it, someone else here will. it's still my body, so I still feel like i'm acomplishing something. 

What seems to bother a select few is the fact that nobody I am friends with, who have known that I have this problem and have had it for a long time, refuse to seperate our personalities. If I feel too stressed, someone else will be taking my place. It doesn't matter if it's someoone who's been here for years, or an aquaintence, they refuse to acknowledge that I'm a different person than them. It doesn't bother me, but it bothers a couple of the people here. 

What bothers *me* is the constant hate that people in my situation get because their symptoms don't line up with the well known DID, but rather OSDD. They are mocked for being trendy and trying to appropriate a mental illness. I understand why people are angry and insulted, but I don't understand at the same time. The experience is real, the memory loss is real, the coping devices are real, and my headmates, as far as i'm concerned, are real. 

I don't know if I wanted to vent, or if I wanted advice. I'm not particularly sure how to bring this topic up without being laughed out of my therapist's office. What if she's just like the people on tumblr who absolutely hate people that dissociate differently? It's not like it's purely intentional or purposeful. 

edit: I had this problem before tumblr existed in my life. I've seen a lot of people trying to say that this stems from tumblr, as if they've invented a mental anomaly. nah. :/",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,"I feel like no matter what, my headmates will never be taken seriously because of tumblr."

I realized not so long ago (maybe ~1 year) that I will most likely spend my whole life alone, not by choice obviously but more because of the natural selection. Back in time, I always knew it would be tremendously difficult for me to get into a relationship with the opposite sex in the future simply because I am not what society expects from somebody. I am in good shape yes, but my face and my social skills are completely besides the standards to a point where I often question my own racial identity, what is the purpose of such humans in this world if they don't get to procreate?

It didn't bother me much until a year ago because I was happily addicted to video games, studying a lot and working out, I was blind about the mediocre importance of my own life in this world. When you think about it, it totally makes sense that not every identities of a specie get to procreate and only those of higher quality according to society should, so the race remains strong and healthy. You can easily observe that phenomenon in the nature as well except that the other species don't live in a structured society. After this understanding, I assume that a wise man would accept his fate and move on with his life despite the fact he would never embrace the feeling of bidirectional love.

I am 23 years old, kissless, virgin of course and depressive, and some might say I am still young and I have plenty of time ahead of me to eventually meet a woman who would not care about my flaws. You are theorically right but the probabilities are against me, I swin against the tide, I am not what a mentality sane woman would seek according to society's indications and I don't see a clear way to fix myself. I am required and expected to have basic experience with women at this point of my life though I have none, I need experience in order to get more experience otherwise I cannot move forward, I am simply stuck with my inability to read women and them reading me. Even if I was a woman I would not approach somebody like myself because I must be a defective specie to never have a relationship at this point, why would I even want to procreate with a rejected product?

That said, even though I have a dacent job (software engineer) that I enjoy, I don't see my life changing for the best, not even in a far future, the lack of motivation is real. I fail to understand the purpose of my life, I fail to be a wise man and bear with my condition even though I tried. The pain is simply too strong to endure, I am probably weak and simple minded for being so depressive about a lack of a relationship but I can't help it, I don't even understand why it seems so important to me, but it is. I just want to love and be loved, it sounds like an amazing feeling yet so inaccessible, out of my reach. It didn't bother me much in the past because I kept myself busy and addicted therefore I didn't really think about this aspect of my life, I thought it would naturally come like it did for most people in this world. Man I was such a mistaken fool.

There I am, cynical, depressive, why did I have to wake up one day and think about this? Why could not I simply stay addicted and busy and enjoy life? Why is it suddenly so important for me to share my life with somebody at this point? Solitude really did hit me like a truck and I have been on a depression for a year now, I am trying to find motivation somewhere, somehow. I sincerely apologize for the long post.

I've lived in two different apartments and had to move back in with my parents because of terrible roommates and lost around $1500 from moving and putting down payments and rent for a place I barely lived in. I've worked my ass off in school and have to completely retake this semester, and it's gotten to the point where I'm sleeping through the day and avoiding everyone.

I was working two jobs to support myself and was on the line to get back into school, then I had to move back in with my mom because by roommate bought weed and booze instead of paying rent. No biggie, quit one job since she lives in a different city than my work and continued getting ready for school. Home life is miserable, I moved out when I was 18 for a reason. Worked my ass off and started classes again, despite feeling like I was just wasting time and money. 

Far forward info the school semester and someone hits and totals my car on the freeway. I end up breaking my dominant hand in two spots and this throws my entire life into the gutter. After two months my old car still hasn't been paid off even though this is an open and close case (other driver rear ended someone else and then slammed into me, admitted under testimony that they were not paying attention and are 100% at fault) and I'm still in physical therapy for my hand. I'm a math major who has to write allot and my school is almost half an hour away going 5 mph over the speed limit the whole way. I ended up missing almost half the semester because I couldn't take notes or couldn't drive. Also lost my job because of the broken hand. Bonus points: two weeks before the accident I spent $1300 fixing my car because I jumped a curb after a 16 hour workday that ended at midnight. Still have $800 left and will not get any compensation for that. Also will not get any compensation or anything for the $1000 wheels I put on the car two months before the crash. Lesson learned: never build on what you have, someone will take it away.

My mom had to buy a new car without any help from me because my case is taking as long as possible and I couldn't work. Ended up getting the base line of the base line and passed her car to me, the car that needs $5000 of work done to it. No biggie, I'll get it done somehow. Continue trying to go to school, but in between my accident and the new car had to share with my mom who works night shift at a hospital. Between that and neither of us having any money I ended up missing too much class to recover. Still tried my best to be optimistic and work through it, but I just slowly got slowed down until i just gave up.

Fast forward again, woke up today for my last final, and I'm completely out of gas. Final starts in ten minutes half an hour away and there's no way I'm getting there. I slept through my other final because I missed the last two weeks of school because I got Bronchitis so bad I had to go to the ER cause I couldn't breath. Figured what was the point?

I've lost every single thing I worked for in the last year. Everything I had was systematically taken from me, and none of it is based on what I did. I work my ass off, I did everything I could and pulled every trick in the book to stay afloat and keep going. But I've just shut down. I'm done. I give up. The fucking world wins, there's nothing left to fight for and nothing left to take. I'm $1300 in debt between my credit card and my car repair, which wouldn't have been a problem when I was making that much a month, I'm $12k in debt for student loans and that's just going to keep going up, my car is gone and every ounce of work I put toward it is gone with it, my job is gone and as much as I hated it I need work, and this entire semester was a waste of time because I have to retake everything. 

Everything that I held on to, everything that kept me waking up in the morning is just gone. Don't know why I'm writing this, don't really care. It's like I'm in a fucking movie, my life is getting torn apart piece by piece, except there's no cute girl at the coffee shop cause I can't afford coffee, there's no dream job just around the corner cause I need a masters degree for that, and there's no miracle waiting to happen cause all that's in this world are just different ways of fucking you up.",depression,t5_2qqqf,Kind of just done

I really wanted to just cry but I kept my head down because ik was embarassed. After class was over my teacher pulled me aside to talk. She's my AP lang teacher and I absolutely adore her. She's awesome in so many ways. I'll call her Ms P. She asked what was wrong and gave me a hug (which she once told us she hates hugs) and talked to me. She's like a mind reader I swear. She said she understood finals are stressful but to not worry about failing her class because she wouldn't fail me. She told me I have beautiful eyes but wished I would look up more since I look down. She also has anxiety, she's told me before in other situations like that.

I turn 20 in January, and I'm going to college for computer engineering. I've had very low self esteem my whole life, I was bullied in grade school, and depression just happened over time, crept up on me. My counselor believes it started when I stopped feeling any sense of positive emotion or excitement towards Christmas, and experienced an indifference towards more and more positive things, which would mean I've been depressed for at least two years. I've been in and out of counseling for several years. I had a period of time in junior high when I self injured, counseling didn't do much for me but I eventually stopped with an enormous amount of willpower. It didn't help with the root problems of depression and low self esteem. I started counseling again in July, and I feel as though that counselor understands me. The thing is that beyond figuring out how my mind works, we have been unable to do anything to fix it. We've tried CBT and I've just been unable to connect with positive ideas, and only become fixated on negative ones. He believed that I had a chemical imbalance, so a week before thanksgiving, I started on wellbutrin but I haven't noticed any changes. My dad is starting to put a lot of pressure on me to change, and keeps asking me why my counselor hasn't done anything to improve my situation.

TL;DR I've had low self esteem my whole life and I've been depressed for at least two years.

Now for a bit of how my mind works. First off, I'm continuously thinking about how my future is going to be terrible. I'm an only child and I believe I'm forever alone, so I see no point in living past my parents' deaths. I plan to outlive them because I owe them that much for investing so much money into me, but beyond that I don't see much point in living with nobody left to care about me.
In everything I do I'm incapable of viewing myself as successful or talented, I either experience an immense feeling of failure, or a combination of denial and indifference. It's very frustrating because I know I'm thinking irrationally, but I'm unable to correct it, because it's so natural to me. This frustration at myself leads to only more self loathing.
I also have a great deal of social anxiety because I view myself so negatively, and assume others do as well, so I decline most invitations to do things outside of video games with my small group of friends. Video games are my only form of escape, because they distract me from myself. Sometimes they can allow for a brief period of happiness, maybe 5 seconds, before the depression comes back and takes it away. Because of my negative self image, I don't even know how or why I have friends, or what they see in me, or even how I made them in the first place. I don't really know what else to say, I feel like my mind is going in a downward spiral that is only going to end very badly. If you've read this far I appreciate it. I apologize for any grammar or typing mistakes I've made, or if you feel I have wasted your time.

TL;DR I feel as though things are already very bad and are only going to get worse. I'm giving up hope that I can overcome my depression and be happy again.

Every time I get a little better for a while, I trick myself into thinking that next time bad stuff happens I'll be stronger next time and I'll be better for it. 

Yeah. Right.

This week I lost my family. Again. I'd recently brought them back into my life after a year of radio silence: I'd blocked all their numbers on AT&T's end so their calls couldn't be completed.

I got into a fight with my mom over Christmas. My eldest sister has kicked me out once and uninvited me another time and this is the third Christmas I've stopped trying. That makes for five years of holidays spent alone. 
 
I asked my mom why she didn't ever stand up for me, if she loved her other kids more because they were welcome at the holidays. She immediately got snappy and said that I just started talking to her again and how was she supposed to know that I wanted to be involved in Christmas. ""I blocked you out of my life, mom, because I told you I was suicidal, like I am now, and you hung up on me.""

And then my mom proceeded to hang up on me.

Two days later I saw my therapist who I had called during this. During the conversation he asked me why I didn't tell him I was suicidal when he asked. I told him it was because I don't have health insurance and I'm not going to tell him the truth because I can't afford the medical bills just because he's afraid of losing his license. (If I told him. Told him I wouldn't go through with it, did any way...)

We spent an hour talking about him. He told me it's not a good therapeutic relationship if he can't trust me. I wound up telling him that we won't have a therapeutic relationship, then, and that I was done. I walked out. We've been working together for over a year and a half. I see him 3X a week.

I ended up having a really nice date that night. I really like him. And even though he's shown nothing but interest in me, I feel like I'm not adequate enough. I can't stop tearing myself apart. My mind and body are just racing with negative thoughts and feelings. I try to be rational, ""he said he wants to see you again,"" the other part of me goes ""but he hasn't tried to make any plans and you are such a fucked up mess that once he finds out he's going to run away and abandon you just like everyone else. You don't have anyone to turn to and you have to hide yourself or everyone will hate you.""

In addition to: ""you can't finish any of your projects all you do is lie in bed and procrastinate"" 

Despite the fact that I went skating for 4 miles yesterday, did an hour and a half of yoga, and painted a piece of furniture. It's never enough. I just tear myself apart. I hate me more than anyone. ",depression,t5_2qqqf,I'm struggling today. Struggling hard.

I thought it would be ok, maybe he would come back and be fine. Well come that Friday he told me we were done he had never loved me, I was just a fuck up to him, that I was just a faggot and how penis was disgusting to him. It was heart breaking to the point where I thought I would hurt myself.

I've never fought with my parents around you. Ever. Sorry if I want to vent about how my mom treats me and looks at me like I'm a freak.

I didn't want to be too depressing for you. I try so hard not to be depressing. You were like me once. Did you forget?

Your best friend stopped talking to you because of your cutting and said you were too depressing and negative. You cried. I stood by you. Did you really forget? I was good to you. I was sad and easily hurt but I was good. I was a good friend. I tried so hard to do everything good friends are supposed to. I talked you out of suicide so many times. I tried to visit you in the mental hospital after you tried killing yourself. They wouldn't let me in. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I ran away when you snapped at me at warped tour. I couldn't hear you. I shut down when people yell at me. I'm sorry I ran. I was scared.

You left me for my last best friend. A liar and a thief. I'm very bad at letting go. When she abandoned me I lost it. I would get home from school early to an empty house and collapse on the floor sobbing because I didn't understand what I did wrong. I still don't understand. I wanderer through our school looking for a way to the roof so that I could jump off. She tries to give me hugs when she sees me. I lose the ability to speak until she goes away.
And then you left me. I thought you were busy at first but you kept ignoring me. I'm sorry I kept calling and sending messages. I just wanted to know what I did wrong. I didn't deserve to be left with no explanation of why my friend had suddenly cut me off. My biggest fear is abandonment.

I think about you both at night a lot. It's been months. Please get out of my head. I don't have any friends anymore.

It takes effort to hide this in my daily professional and social life -- receiving a compliment and not refuting it goes against every instinct in my body. Sometimes it's not even compliments -- just people being nice to me is enough to trigger (ugh I hate to use the cliche word, but it applies) me. I almost would rather not receive compliments because of the mental hurdles I have to go through to accept it: 


*internal dialogue to the compliment giver*: You're a liar. You just feel sorry for me. I know the truth, which is that I am shit and deserve to be slaughtered. I would like to get out of your sight as soon as possible so that you do not accidentally hear my thoughts out loud and I can deal with the imminent fallout precipitated by your kind and innocuous comment.

*internal dialogue to self, triggered by the compliment*: You fucking whore, bitch. Fuck you whore, bitch. x10-20 + fantasizing about killing and hurting myself on bad days.

Then my therapist's voice comes in with ""what reason would they have to lie"" and ""if they really had an issue with you they would come to you about it"" and ""they are not intending to cause you internal distress so take a deep breath and say thank you""

So I take a deep breath and say thank you like a functional person, but it sticks with me, because I have to compulsively go down the list of examples in how they are wrong and I am right. It is a compulsion. I have to do it. I mean, they deserve all the facts. **How can they say something nice about me when they don't know all the facts?** (this last question is an old one in my life, worked through on multiple occasions in therapy sessions, and the fact that it is coming up now and plus I'm talking about compulsions points to I need my meds adjusted)

I just want to die sometimes. A lot of the time. I just want to lay down and die, and not have to have the same fight with myself every moment of every day. I've worked through all of my issues in therapy. None of my triggers are new or unturned. I'm so practiced at receiving therapy that I can basically perform therapy on myself (as evidenced in this post), but even though I know what is normal thinking and what is depressed thinking, the physical reality is that it hurts all the time and I'm so tired of the fight. I'm not suicidal, I just want to not be noticed or remembered. If I could just be invisible I think I would be so much happier, because I wouldn't have to work so hard to control what other people's perception of me is, which I know is something I *can't* control, and my *trying* to control it is a sign of depression and low self-esteem and probably another lovely artifact of emotional abuse.

There's a limit to what therapy and meds can do. I'm not drowning anymore, but I don't think I'll ever get beyond treading water. Partly because I don't think I deserve to not have to tread water, and partly because I don't know what the fuck I would do otherwise.  

tl;dr: I don't know what people think about if they are not busy hating themselves. ",depression,t5_2qqqf,"my predilection for self-abuse is honestly quite impressive, just a vent"

I Have friends but idk they never seem to understand how hard it is to be me. I've lost friends because of this whole atheism thing. I've been having a hard time being creative, it's like my whole vibe is just off but it's been off for a while now and it's bothering me. It's affecting my education. School is a major factor in my situation as well. I feel like I can't fit in with them. I Can try but I don't want to pretend that i'm part of them just for the sake of fitting in. I don't blame my classmates or anyone for whatever's happening to me, i blame myself.

Family wise, I'm not really close to my sisters or my mom. My dad on the other hand died when I was 11 so that's out of the question. I'm very different from my own family. They're all Catholics and i'm the only one who's an atheist.

A Few weeks ago I skipped school for a whole week and had drowned myself in alcohol for that whole week. I Was drunk 90% of the time then. I Just couldn't handle being in school anymore. Transferring is out of the question, i've wasted enough money and time. Apart from that, there's this girl who made me feel happy for a short time. The problem is i felt attached, but sadly she's now with another guy. A Christian guy. I feel like all of this is because of me being an atheist.

I'm content with you guys just answering this question rather than giving me advice, but i'd also like it if you guys would give me advice.

The question is: Do I need or have to change everything about me? I like myself now to be honest. Ever since I became an atheist I saw the world more differently, i've been more selfless and more passive. I Try to understand people much more than i try to understand myself. I like the way i think now, I like the way that I am now compared to who I was a few years ago, but I feel lonely and I feel like there's something wrong.

Really; your carotid artery carries a ton of blood and it's basically pinchable.  It just seems much easier and less spastic.  

I'm comfortable with this.  My parents call and all I can remember is them telling me about how I should be thankful because they were paying for my college.  I can remember them making me go to a psychologist when I didn't want to and then preventing me from going once I finally liked it.  I remember my dad punching me at the dinner table when I was 14.   I remember my mom yelling at me because I was going to fail out of college after my roommate beat me up and my school threatened to expel me for it and refused to let me move to a different room.   I remember my older sister calling me a racist, and how she got every one to get mad at me for ruining Christmas two years ago because I couldn't get out of bed, and how once they finally dragged me out I wasn't excited enough for the gifts they got me.   I remember how my parents bought me some things that I wanted past year, and then never took the time to ship them down to me.  I remember how I put 200 hours into fixing a car, and gave it to my parents when I didn't need it and they did on the condition that my younger sister didn't drive it because there's 10 degrees of dead play in the steering wheel and it's hard to control.  I remember when they gave it to her two weeks later and then she got drunk and totaled it.   I shouldn't have spent those two months cleaning the stink bugs out.  

I'm not even really emotional about it anymore.  I've been a walking cadaver for 9 years now and I used to get emotional about it, but that was always over a desperate sense of hope that something would go in a way that wasn't abrasive to me.  I guess Ive just come to terms that it won't ever.  I've had double vision for three years now and the doctors basically just give me diagnoses that they're comfortable with and get mad at me when I tell them they don't make sense for the following reasons. 

I mean, so many people younger than me have gotten killed in Vietnam, the civil war, world war 2, etc.  Im lucky enough that I won the birthing lottery and grew up in the U.S. in a financially self sufficient family.  I'm strong enough that I became an engineer and I guess functional enough that I do a decent job.  

I just don't really care about living any more.  This sort of thing doesn't even choke me up any more.   I've checked off everything meaningful on my list, and it hasn't met the expected returns.  I don't think I want to owe anyone anything else.  My dad was begging me to congratulate my younger sister on graduating college.  It's awful that I probably won't because of how traumatizing it was for me to try to find my parents during the post-grad reception only to find out they left early to feed the dogs.  I had no one to talk to.  Everyone else I knew was talking to their parents.   I drank two champagnes, stood around looking around trying to take in the reality of the situation, and then left.  

That's kind of what I want to do with Christmas.  Be alone, observe, and leave still alone.

My mom says i should have patience and that the right person will come eventually. I seriously doubt that. A lifetime of rejection has taught me that I'll die alone.

It hurts that no one cares about me. Feeling so alone. I wish I could go back in time and beat the shit out of the assholes who tormented me in school, maybe then I wouldn't have ended up like this. Full of hatred and hopelessness. 

I take tons of meds to prevent me from harming myself and flipping out due to he frustration. People say im still young but they don't understand what it's like to have never been loved, at least wanted, or pursued in my entire life.

I can't rely on hope or destiny. I don't believe in those things. Life's not like on the movies where there's always a happy ending for those who've been hurt. 

In real life...some people just wither slowly and keep being unhappy until they die. Alone

I was deep in the grips of drug abuse at the time and I feel like that was a reason why the assaults happened. I didn't report it or go to the hospital at the time because honestly, the entire time I hoped one of the men would just kill me so it would all be over. I never sought counseling because I really didn't and still am not really sure about how to go about it. I kind of just tried to suppress everything in the back of my mind and not let the flashbacks and anxiety and panicky moments take control and it worked for a while until recently. 

I gave birth to my son 6 months ago and not long after that, I ran into one of the attackers I recognized in the store across the street from my house and everything flooded back into my mind like a tidal wave. I talked to my partner about the rape that that attacker was involved in and he was very supportive but I couldn't tell him everything else that happened. 

Within the past month everything has been getting worse. I don't sleep much anymore, I don't like going anywhere because I'm afraid seeing a certain kind of man will trigger me, I cry every night when the memories come back and it seems like I can't remember crucial parts which just makes me feel worse. The only way I've ever known to make bad feelings go away was to turn to drugs but I cleaned myself up for my relationship and my child and I'm so terrified of relapsing back into that void.

I'll change the names for the sake of identities.

It all started with the Fall 2014 semester. It's my second semester in college and I still hadn't made friends. I had one acquaintance from the previous semester, but still no friends. I stepped into English class for the first time, and she caught my eye. I thought there was something attractive about her. Was it her hair? Was it her face? Was it her eyes? Was it her smile? It was more like everything combined. But still, so what? I've seen a million girls who have caught my attention. But it wasn't long before I developed an insane crush over her. I heard her speak in English class and I fell in love with her full and grammatically correct sentences, and the wide vocabulary she had. This only made my crush even worse. The class met on Mondays and Wednesdays. Each Monday, I would go home, loathing myself, feeling depressed for not talking to her, and saying I would talk to her on Wednesday. I also noticed that she's in the same Engineering lecture as me on Fridays. But I knew that because it was a lecture, there was no chance of me ever hitting up a conversation with her on Fridays. There were just too many people. In English, it would be much easier because it's a small class, and we sit not too far from each other. On Mondays, I waited for Wednesdays. On Wednesdays, I hoped anything would happen on Fridays. On Fridays, I said ""Monday it is."" This went on for weeks. A month had gone by, and I still hadn't said anything. How could I talk to her? I'm that kid who sits in the corner, and she's this pretty girl who probably has a few hundred guys much more confident than me and much more charming than me hitting on her. Just stalking her Facebook was enough to tell me that. She had over 500 friends, and counting, while I had some 80 friends, most of which were family members. She probably had a few boyfriends in high school, while I am this 19 year old guy who has never had a girlfriend and still hasn't had his first kiss. I'm not fat or ugly or anything. I've been told I'm handsome by quite a few people. But due to my upbringing, I ~~am~~ was incredibly socially awkward. I graduated high school with less than a handful of friends. 

On a Wednesday, I sat next to her. More accurately, I was already sitting there. It was her who walked in and took the empty seat next to me. I tried so hard to start a conversation with her, but I couldn't. I just couldn't. I couldn't think of anything to say. I couldn't do anything. I was too self-aware. I didn't know where to put my arms. I was worrying about how loud my breathing. I didn't know how to swallow my saliva.
Then one day, after English class, on a Monday, I caught up with her and said ""I like your hair."" She replied in a ""thanks"" as I walked away fast. My hands were shaking. I was sweating. I can't talk to people, let alone compliment a crush. Yet I did it. I don't know how I did it, but I can tell you one thing: I was determined on saying something that day. What I wanted to say, however, wasn't planned. It just came out. In fact, it took me a few seconds to realize what I had said. Two days later, on a Wednesday, I saw her in class wearing an Attack on Titans survey corps jacket. I love Attack on Titan. I thought ""this is my chance."" After class, again, I caught up to her and said ""You like Attack on Titan?"" She nodded and said ""Yea."" I held my phone up to show her my background, which happened to be an Attack on Titan background. She smiled and said ""Yooo!"" Then I just walked away. My nerves couldn't let me say anything more. Had I stood there for a few minutes, I would've puked or fell or something, I don't know. Then came the following Monday, and I did nothing. Then on the Wednesday after, she was sitting within talking distance of me. I turned to her and said ""You like Attack on Titan, right?"" She said ""Yeah."" I said ""You watch other Anime?"" She said ""Yeah. You like Tokyo Ghoul?"" It just so happened that I had finished Tokyo Ghoul a few days before that and my Facebook cover photo was a picture of Kaneki. After class, I waited for her and talked to her about anime some more while walking. It just so happened that she was going in the same direction as me to the same train station, so we walked together and talked. I threw in ""I'm Armin, by the way."" She said ""I know."" I looked at her weirdly, she said ""I tried to memorize the names of people in my classes."" Weird, but okay. I do the same thing myself. I knew the names of half the kids in my high school, most of which I never had any interactions with. Up to that moment, that was the happiest day in my life. I'm even smiling just typing this as I recall it. Then came Friday. I saw her in the lecture. She didn't say hi. I was sure she saw me, yet she didn't say ""hi."" So I went up to her and said ""hi."" She replied with a ""hi"" and a smile, which at the time felt good, but now, knowing her better, I could tell that it was a very half-assed smile that she gives to anyone whenever she doesn't know what else to do. Then came Monday. Nothing. I said nothing. And she said nothing. Then came Wednesday. I said nothing. And she said nothing. No hi. Nothing. At all. I felt depressed and terrible. This was the start of my depression. On the train home, I decided to pull out my phone and add her on Facebook. I was desperate. She didn't accept. Knowing how I know her phone was glued to her butt, I felt depressed. It kept me wondering all day. Then I woke up the next day only to see that she accepted, and this made my day. For a good part of the day, I was really happy. But at night time, I became depressed once more, for no reason that I can recall. So I sent her a message on Facebook. The message said ""I know I'm coming off as a creep and honestly, I wouldn't blame you for thinking I'm one. I just thought you were an interesting person and I wanted to get to know you but I struggle to talk with new people so as a result, I could easily come off as creepy. I just added you on facebook to tell you this because I just wanted to make sure everything is clear. Soo yeah I'm sorry if I came off as creepy or anything. Oh and to save you the awkwardness, you don't have to reply to this message."" I was reluctant to send this message, then I quickly pressed enter and closed the screen because I just had to send it and I couldn't chicken out anymore. This lifestyle of chickening out wasn't going to work anymore. I had to face my anxiety. If I had any hope of ever ending up with her, I had to face my demons. I'm 19 years old, for God's sake. I'm going to be 20 in a few months. I'm going to be a 20 year old with barely any friends, never had a girlfriend, and never had a first kiss. I had to do it, and that was the first step.

At this point, it's getting hard to type. It's tearing me up just remembering this, but I'll power through it. 
She replied. She was really sweet about it, but not really sweet, I now realize. At the time, it felt like she was sweet. She said I didn't come off as creepy, and she's sorry if she made me feel so. At the time, that felt sweet. But now, I realize that's what anyone in her position would've said. She quickly changed the topic to Tokyo Ghoul, we chatted (just a few messages), then she said she's going to bed (I now realize that going to bed part was probably absolute BS because it was around 11 PM and now I know she usually sleeps around 3 AM). On the next day, Friday, she saw me in the lecture and said hi, and I said hi. Nothing special. Over the following two to three weeks, we didn't talk much in class, but I made sure to start a chat with her whenever I could on Facebook. Most of the time, she replied. But on some occasions, she didn't reply, and that absolutely destroyed me. The few times when she didn't reply made me feel like shit. Like I said, I had fallen into depression and while I tried my best to stay positive, for the most part I felt like shit and the slightest thing was enough to make me fall into it even deeper. (For about a month or so, I would go to classes, come back home, eat, sleep, wake up, and the cycle goes on. I couldn't do anything productive. I couldn't study. I couldn't do homework. Even when I tried, I just couldn't I couldn't bring myself to focus. That's why I'm currently failing Chemistry and Calculus and my last hope is the finals, in less than 48 hours, and I don't think I'm going to be able to do any good on those in my current state.)

On the Monday after Halloween (specifically, on that weekend, I had sent her a message on Facebook that she didn't reply to), I walked into class early, and there she was, sitting in the empty classroom. She looked at me, but said nothing. I said nothing. I took a seat, and sat there for a few minutes contemplating. Then I decided to say it. ""Hi, Natalie."" That's not her actual name. She said hi back. I said ""How was your weekend?"" (I got that line as a conversation starter from 500 days of summer). She went on for a bit about how she spent her Halloween and weekend. This was the start of something; of a friendship, as brief as it was. On the next Wednesday, I helped her fix something on her phone. On the weekend following that, I helped her with her calculus homework (on Facebook). Eventually, we started talking a lot, as friends. We would sit next to each other all the time in class, talk before and after class, wait for each other after class, and walk together after class. So far so good, right? 

Over the course of this brief friendship, I discovered some qualities in her that attracted me to her even more. Those qualities are: she shares my love of Harry Potter, and shares my hate of Divergent. She likes Star Wars (or does she? I asked her if she does and she said she does, but she stuttered when remembering Anakin's name, and she didn't know who ""Hayden Christensen"" is). She likes to read, so do I. She likes to watch anime, so do I (although she's much more into anime than I am. I'm an entry-level anime guy, while she's an expert at it and has all of these cosplayer friends and even goes to all these cosplay events). Funnily enough, I had always ridiculed such people before I met her. I had no life, but even to me, cosplaying and taking such things seriously was ridiculous and below having no life (no offense to anyone who likes them. That was just my opinion), yet I completely ignored that and even started to admire it when I found out she liked it. As far as I was concerned, I had found the most perfect girl, and I'll be damned if I let her go. She's smart, pretty, funny (is she? I laughed at all her jokes, but when I retold them to my friends, they said they're shit), intelligent, the list is endless. A typical crush. How can there possibly be an imperfection in a crush? Even if there is an imperfection, you turn it into a perfection. And that was the case with her. 

Over the course of our brief friendship, I also discovered a bunch of negative qualities in her. Qualities that I now realize I absolutely loathe, but at the time, I chose to completely overlook or make excuses for. She's a feminazi. She's one of those extremely liberal people who reach a level of retardation (I'm a liberal myself, but she's one of those that take small meaningless words and could start arguments about them). She told me she's a chilled out person and dislikes going into arguments, yet she ventured into various arguments with me whenever I hinted a different view. I let her win all of them, which I now regret. I would always playfully say ""okay fine, you win"" even though what she had said was absolutely fucking retarded, if not completely off topic, and I could counter-argue. But I let her win. I regret this. I made myself look stupid in front of her, for her. Even in English class, we got into a semi-argument in a class discussion about the poem ""lighght."" I had said the poem is absolutely meaningless and if that is considered a poem, a five year old could be the next Edgar Allan Poe. I didn't say that to her, but to the class and the teacher. She replied by saying ""Except a five year old wouldn't think about writing that poem."" I already had the counter-argument set up in my head. ""Think about what? You think this is a poem because you were told it is a poem. You think this is a poem because you were told the poet was creative enough to type it up and sold it to you as a poem. But had I handed you this so-called poem without saying anything or even telling you it's a poem, you would've thrown it in the garbage, because you wouldn't have been able to make anything of it and you would've just thought it was a typo of some kind. It's a poem because you decided to consider it a poem, not because it's actually a poem."" But I didn't say anything. I just nodded and said ""yeah, I guess."" I regret this a lot. As I'm typing this, I loathe myself for not saying that. I now realize that even talking to her was challenging. She wasn't a fun person to talk with. She's selfish, conversation-wise. Unless you made the topic about her somehow, she wouldn't really talk. She would just nod along or stay quiet. Worst of all, she would sometimes pull out her phone and start scrolling through it. I didn't realize that at the time, even though my friend, who has the same class as us and knows her on first-name basis, explicitly said it to me. To make conversations with her, I had to ask her questions or keep things revolving around her. She wanted all the attention. Even the small comments she occasionally said to me, which at the time I thought were cute and showed her shyness, I now realize were acts of selfishness from her; attention-whoring, more or less. ""If he did that to me, I would cry,"" she once told me after the teacher sent out a guy for not doing an assignment and telling him to type up an explanation for why he hadn't done the assignment and come back with it 5 minutes before the class ended. And she once mentioned how there's almost always some guy on the subway who wants to hit up a conversation with her. At the time, I thought ""awww, so cute."" But now I realize that's just her attempt at attention-whoring. Though admittedly, there's an old post on her wall from a guy who says ""Thanks for adding me on facebook and making the train ride so much fun!"" or something along those lines.",socialanxiety,t5_2r22n,The story of how I broke out of my shell of social anxiety.

I was doing some reflection today. Still depressed. Check. Somewhat functional at least. I'm not in one of the low points, I'm midway at the moment. Today I've been noticing just how strange some of the things that set me off are.

I often get this feeling of sadness when I'm about to leave the house. When I'm just about to shower or have just finished getting dressed. It's not like a heavy depression feeling. Not like usual. It's just a... light sadness. I can still function, but I'm sad. I think it's a mix of melancholy and regret. As if I'm saying goodbye to something. Post partum depression. 

Another, more common thing that sets me off is the moment AFTER socialising. I'm usually ok when in social situations, with varying degrees of success. I'm funny. I'm jolly. People seem to like me. I make a fool of myself, but it's ok. But then, the moment that I leave the conversation/party/whatever I feel this tremendous sense of sadness. Regret. Melancholy. Like the feeling after the end of the climax of the movie and you're back down to earth. ""Now what?'

I haven't told anyone about it, and I mean anyone, not even my best friend. 
I just felt like me having some alone time, with just myself would help me a lot, and it has, that's why I left early. The only person that knew I was going home was my flatmate. So I pretty much just got up and left, I also decided that this alone time would start as soon as I got home, so I deactivated my Facebook and threw my phone to one corner of the room, and now have a schedule, I go gym in the morning/ go on a run (well most days, it's still pretty hard forcing myself to do these things) and then I force myself to do revision and stuff. 
Cutting myself away from people feels like it's working so much! Before I went home, I literally missed a whole month of university, I would just stay in bed all day and do nothing! The only time I'd ever leave the house would be if people asked me if I wanted to go drink/ do drugs.

My best friend sent me a few messages, and I replied once telling her that I was ok and just needed a bit of space and that I'll see her after new years, she was super understanding and I think she has an idea what's happening, I got a text from her out of nowhere just saying that if I needed a chat whenever if life got a bit glum or weird that I should call her and stuff but shes ried calling me a few times and ive just ignored her.

For the past coming two years I've been living with my girlfriend (same sex relationship) in her place. Just some background info, I'm almost 21 and she's 25. I'm at a university, she's working full-time at a very busy job. In that two years there have been very, very wonderful times - she's the one big love of my life and we can complement each other amazingly when I'm not being a mean bitch - but there have also been some horrible low points. Almost always, these low points are the product of my own doing.


I found myself having bouts of rage at very small issues, for example she being a few minutes late in coming home when she said she would come home at a certain time. Over such a small thing, I can blow up at her, scream and yell at her saying she's undependable. I always find myself ending up hysterical. After a while I would calm down and apologize, but the damage is already done. Sometimes my rage is so bad that I just want to smash things up, and I have punched and pushed her on a number of times in my rage.


I would also constantly pick on her for no real reason, which makes her feel like I don't love her and detests her. I will nag at everything and have become controlling also. I get upset when she leaves to meet her friends (even though I say I wouldn't be upset), when she spends too much time at work etc. I feel like she doesn't spend enough time with me, even though we pretty much live together and she spends all her free time with me. I am so controlling that I check her phone, ask about what she talks about to her friends, and even prevents her from hanging out with certain people that I don't like. For example one of her friends has said that I should not be trusted, and because of that I forced my girlfriend to say mean and hurtful things to that friend.


More than that, I find myself feeling empty almost all the time, although sometimes this emptiness is replaced by feelings of happiness and warmth. I don't know why I feel empty when my life seems almost picturesque. My girlfriend spoils me, treats me to holidays, buy me pretty things, expensive things and jewelry that I love. Still I feel that my life is empty and I have hated it at times. My girlfriend hates when I feel that way because she does everything to make me happy - I get to do whatever I want whenever I want, she brings me wherever I want to go and I am rarely denied what I want. We even got a puppy so I would feel less lonely and empty. The puppy has helped me, but it has caused strain to our relationship as he takes a lot of time and effort. 


I keep a personal blog about my feelings, especially towards the relationship. Reading back, it feels almost like as if I have split personalities. One week I feel like I'm on top of the world, the next week life is meaningless. One week I say that she is my absolute everything, the next week I say I no longer have feelings for her.


I don't feel sad very often, I would rather much be angry. So whenever I feel sad, if possible, I turn it to anger. I always take my anger out on her. I don't know why I do it but sometimes it feels like I just snap at her and I usually regret it but don't know how to show it because despite me saying I will change, I have only gotten worse. When I am sad, I feel so in despair and hopeless, and there are so many tears. I also cry over strange things, and don't cry when I am ""supposed"" to cry. That gets her very annoyed as she thinks that I cry over trivial things and she gets frustrated. I am also hateful and am filled with thoughts of petty revenge when I feel that people wrong me. I have acted on one thought of such petty revenge and pretty much ruined my relationship with the girlfriend, which is now causing me to feel absolutely hopeless and even suicidal.


My school life is in shambles but I don't care. I don't really have a passion for anything right now..although I love my girlfriend very much. She does everything for me - she cleans, she pays the bills, takes care of me. I always feel very grateful to her, but still I can't seem to stop treating her badly. We both attribute my behaviour to me having a ""bad heart"" and me being a mean person, so I've never considered myself to be depressed. 


The last month we moved into a new house with her mother and sister, and I had been feeling VERY stressed out there. I feel like I no longer have my own personal space, I have to be on my toes at all times, and have to act very carefully to get her mother to accept me. Her mother kicked me out after a month because she thought I was disrespectful to her, and it didn't make sense to me because she made me feel that she and I had quite a decent relationship we both we're working on. That made me feel very wronged and angry, I felt she was being hypocritical. For revenge, I played a prank on her that went badly and now my girlfriend has broken up with me because she feels that I am just mean and disgusting and wants nothing to do with me.


Now I am back at my parents' place for the first time in two years, have brought home with me my puppy that I am told I cannot keep here, and have lost the love of my life. Everything seems bleak and hopeless and the only thing I want is my girlfriend back. I consulted a professional over the phone and he suggested that I might have clinical depression. Can that be why i am so evil? Or like what my girlfriend says, do I just have a bad heart and am psychotic? Sorry for the long post..",depression,t5_2qqqf,Am I depressed or just psychotic?

- This year I landed my dream job
- no one in my immediate family or friends has died
- I have also not died and all my limbs and organs are functioning properly at the moment (for the most part.)
- I am not homeless, and I can eat without wondering where my next meal is comings from so money problems well we'll get to that. 

Now for the FML parts. 
- This year I have been robbed through intimidation once (Literally by the Yakuza) 
- I have been drugged and robbed on a separate occasion. 
- scammed out of a shifty hotel deal
- As a consequence number 2 I missed a very important meeting and was in the dog house for 3 months or so at work as a consequence. 
- My would be fiance and are broken up ""for now"" 
- my blood pressure is up, and getting passed the threshold of healthy, 
- Before all of this I have been paying for classes which it turns out won't count as credits toward my CPA so ""hurrah"" so I'm pretty much broke. 
- Oh yeah I don't work in my native language so thats fucking stressful. 
- I live clear across the planet from my home town. 
- when you enter working life all your friends are always busy all the time, that or I'm just becoming really unlikable, either way amounts to the same thing. 
- oh I was pushed out of a train, which yeah it wasn't moving, but the story itself is quite racist. 
- I can't hold down food anymore so as a result of vomiting on a near regular basis my tooth enamel is eroding slowly so that's fun. I can't wait to see where that goes. 
- the activities I've used to escape (games) are now as political as ever making visiting those communities more stressful than ever. 
- Every now and I get strange headaches that feel like there's a been resting in the top of my skull so I like to pretend that this is going to kill me but it's probably just uncomfortable. 

Needless to say, I'm not doing well. I'm not ok, and I won't make it through 2015 if it's anything like this. I just don't have it in me. I've had some bad things come my way, and maybe a lot of it is my fault. 
But what if there was a death? What if someone really close me passed away? What if I had been physically harmed? I don't think I could take that. Doesn't help that I can barely afford to go to my fucking therapist, which in all fairness to him is not his fault. but seriously and definitively FUCK 2014. I'm ready for this shit to be over.

  To be honest, I am on 350 milligrams of different antidepressants, so I am beginning to feel a bit less ""sad"".  What has replaced that sadness, though, is anger.  I think I was too depressed to even notice my anger, but as my depression dies down my anger grows.  I can hide it, but sometimes I just wanna punch something (usually ends up being a wall).  I just feel like shit all the time and it gets a lot worse when I see two people.

There was this girl that I really, really liked.  I have never had such a big crush before.  I think its because of my depression that I pretty much developed an emotional attachment to her, and she was my motivation for going through the day.  Now I am not an unattractive guy, and have plenty of friends who are girls and will often joke around with them. Like just out of nowhere I will say ""I love you"", and the randomness of it always makes them laugh.  Why I say this is because I could not build up the courage to say it to this girl.  Its so easy to say to other people, but I could not even approach this girl I was really scared.

She clearly did not like me in that way, and was unofficially rejected once (long story), but never had I told her how I felt.  So during a 15 minute break our entire school had, I was gonna ask her out.  So I found her, and she was walking with this guy.  Now her friends told me they did not think they were dating or anything, so I just asked her ""Hey, can I ask you something?""  She said to him ""Ooook lets go over there"", trying to avoid the situation.  Now I was expecting to be rejected, but what happened next is what got me.  The guy said ""If you are thinking of asking her out, dont do it bud, cause shes mine"", and walked off with her laughing.  

In that moment, my world reverted back to its dark, decaying form, for that light, that hope that I emotionally invested myself in was lost.  I was not as sad as I thought I would be, but the darkness started fading away and was replaced with fire.

  I was filled with rage, more angry than I ever was before.  I wanted to fucking kill him.  And I know I could too (for reference, I take Krav Maga).  I know that if I did that though, I would ruin my life.  So here I am, living out my days in agonizing rage.  Whenever I see him, I start shaking with anger.  Hes like a target that I cannot shoot at.  What makes me the most angry is that I still like her after all this.  I cannot let go of her no matter how hard I try.  And after all this she still fucking stares at me, I will catch out of the corner of my eye her and her friends looking at me, and I get mixed signals and dont know what to think.  Thats what makes me the most angry, is because I dont know what to think.  I dont know what to do.  Its just fucked up, and I just dont know what to do.  Im scared I will snap and actually kill this guy.  But at the same time, I want it to happen.  I want to lose control.  I want to unleash my fury.  The beast inside.

I had been worried about this course because I screwed a project up early on, but I kicked ass on the last couple, and I've come to see the one that I failed as a largely circumstantial issue.

Basically, I think that I have a measure of aptitude for computer science and I'm unsure of how to cultivate it. I have enough time left in college to complete a minor, but I'm terrified that I'll fail or have to withdraw from a class, thus taking me even longer to graduate. 

When it comes to college, I'm really just finishing what I started. I came in as an English major, which I've largely lost interest in and have little intent to pursue after graduation. I don't want to dropout after all of the work I've put in, but I also don't want to stay longer than necessary to complete a minor which I may or may not be successful in. If I just finish my major requirements and electives, I can be out in two more semesters. Completing the minor could take longer.

I know that if I want to pursue anything with comp sci, it's prudent to have a piece of paper saying that I completed a given number of courses at a university, but I also feel like anything short of a major in the field isn't going to immediately land me a job, and it might be more pragmatic to smoothly sail through the rest of college, and take more of a ""do it yourself"" approach to computer science. It's not even something that I'm passionate about, I just think that I'm reasonably good, could get better, and am attracted to that in a bad economy. I find everything in life so f-cking difficult that I'm willing to work hard at it.

I'm 24 and I feel like i've been falling further into a hole for years now. I've been tired for as long as I can remember no matter how much sleep or exercise I get. I'm always late for work because even though I get up at 7, I can't even get out of bed for hours and just keep going back to sleep. Every night I have to fall asleep with the TV on or my mind just wanders, I upset myself, and then become restless. I feel like I'm constantly on the verge of breaking out into tears and have actually broken down a few times for no apparent reason. Even when I'm happy, I still feel numb at the core. The only person who I've  completely opened up to about how bad I actually feel all the time is my doctor and his immediate reaction was to tell me to lose weight and I might feel better.

The problem is, outwardly my character is just lazy and forgetful. I've lost control once and told everyone I don't like myself, but everyone's attributed it to me confessing to a friend that I liked her and getting rejected(which didn't help, but it's just the tip of the iceberg). No one really takes it seriously, but I've tried to take my life twice now and the only thing that's holds me back is my fear of death.

I'm very quickly just running out of things that make me happy. I used to love playing music but now I can't even pick up my horn and just get sad at how far I've fallen. I used to love playing games, but now I just move so slow and can't enjoy it. The only thing I have left is reading, but I can barely bring myself to open a book and just open netflix. My love life is nonexistent and I feel like i'm getting further and further from the age where I can explain why I haven't kissed a girl or had sex. Everything I touch I just destroy. 

Objectively, I don't have much reason to feel depressed. I call myself ugly but it could be worse. I know more obese people that at least look happier. There's people who have been through a lot more, but I just can't help feeling empty and alone even when I'm surrounded by people that love me.

So if this turns into yet another rant about my medical issues I apologize in advance but I'm wondering if anyone might be able to shed some light on whether or not my therapist's thoughts might come true. I'm going in for a psych-eval in 3 weeks and I just don't know if I'm ready for what might come to light.

So a bit of background. I group up in a house that was constantly in chaos. My parents took turns being the drunk lunatic and either demoralizing or hitting the other all my life. My dad has been arrested 4 times and finally started to turn himself around. However, my mother developed alcoholism and a cocktail of personality disorders. I've finally moved out of my parents' home but I have 23 years of sleepless night and seeing my parents beat each other.

I've been suicidally depressed before and have attempted suicide 3 times. This was years ago! Don't worry about me right now...kinda.

So I've been seeing a counselor for about 4 months now through my workplace and in our final meeting she believes that I might be bipolar. I've taken a few tests over the internet (I know these aren't true! Calm down. Self-diagnosing is silly) and all of them have indicated severe bipolar issues.

Basically I have cyclical mood swings where I'm ""okay"" for a week or two at a time and then I become depressed to the point of dysfunction. In my ""up"" weeks I'm fairly hyperactive and I'm also extremely productive. I barely sleep and my anxiety runs fairly high which drives me to keep working on things as much as possible. It's a blessing and a curse because I get so much done but I'm exhausted from the moment I wake up until I go to bed. 

In my ""Down"" periods I tend to be extremely reclusive. I don't want to be around other people. I'm paranoid about everything that happens around me. All it takes is one thing someone says to set me off and I need to go find the nearest public restroom to go cry in. In a phrase, it's hard to just participate in the human race.

Some of my symptoms are loss of apatite, constant fatigue, violent mood swing even when in a good mood, thoughts of self-mutilation, anger, depression, anxiety, and the list goes on and on. I almost hospitalized myself a few weeks ago because of how bad it got. I had a 3 day period where I actually couldn't feel anything physically or emotionally.

So, do you guys have any suggestions about how to handle all these different mood swings? 
Is there anything I should bring up in my evaluation?
What should I avoid?
Can someone please validate my feelings? I honestly have no one in my life who even fathoms how I feel. Even my two friends who struggle with depression don't know how the hell I keep going.

I'm afraid to go to sleep, because when I do, it's almost immediate that I'm reliving the most horrible things. I've had that before and they have been bad but never like this. These are VERY graphic and in a lot of cases in an excruciatingly painful slow motion kind of thing so every detail is brought out and I can physically feel it all as if it is happening right now. A lot of times all the traumas merge and different scenes play with different people. I feel like it's creating new traumas now with these combinations.  I wake up freezing and sweating and my whole body hurts and I can feel the fear down to my fingertips. I look around for the one person that keeps me safe and he is not here. I call out for him, even though I know he is not here. I am completely alone and can't make sense out of this all. I feel disgusting and ashamed. 

Wondering why I have to live like this. That is when I go to sleep, being awake is often times no better, especially at night or in the evening. Night/evening is when the majority of my sexual and/or violent terrifying traumas happened and it is the worst time for me. That doesn't account for any of the emotional stuff that is on top of all of this.  The flashbacks are just as clear and physically I can feel them, even though I guess my eyes can see that it's not happening.  But I feel like a freak because sometimes I can't tell. I get lost. And without someone here to anchor me or to keep me here, I feel like one of these times I'm just going to drift away completely. So, asleep or awake, it's hell. 

All this and these holidays makes it so difficult to stay here even one more day. I know it is close to the holidays and ""leaving"" during the holidays will do some damage, but what about me?  What about all I had to go through, all I go through again now, all I've lost, my lack of any kind of future, being away from the one person I love and who keeps me safe.

Because i only work minimum wage I couldn't pay all the rent when it was due, had to pay the $100 fine/penalty. the next few days after my anxiety attack i got really sick, couldn't move my body hands were still shaking. I couldn't think straight, there were things i did that i can't recall clearly I even got lost coming back home from picking up some headache meds because no one was there for me. And i was emotionally shot, I took that job because my friends worked there and they were under staffed; 6 people including me worked at this fast food place. 

But now, I just feel guilty and ashamed for just quitting and leaving them with a larger and longer work shift. I've tried talking to them but they are either busy, sick with the flu/cold, or flat out tired, And I get that. But to top it off, my boyfriend breaks up with me at a point were i'm already stretched thin still out of it mentally and very depressed. I don't want to say it like this but at the time and day and the how he broke up with me literally almost killed me. I actually tried to commit suicide. he could have just waited a day, maybe, I was just starting to feel physically better but what he did just destroyed everything for me. I had a feeling it would end soon but I just couldn't handle it that day.

I know he asked me questions like 'where do you see us?' and 'how do you feel about me?' I had those answers I just couldn't say the words because i was just out of it. Now my paranoia and anxiety are kicking up again and all i think of is he did it on purpose and that it would be easier for him.I really wish he would have just stabbed me in the heart instead of waiting for me to do it when he left.

He's says we can still be good friends, and what's left of me really hopes that to be true. I don't have any other friends up here. but now he's moved into the same house as all my other friends and it feels so awkward and crushing to hang out or try to visit my friends cause he'll be there. I also keep asking him to talk to me for the past 2 weeks, he says he's busy,they all say that' but i see him driving around town with people, visiting other friends. I was sitting down eating at the fast food restaurant and my friends show up for work. Not a single hello, i was there for thirty minutes and no one spoke to me. Even people who knew i used to work there and knew that we are/were friends noticed something was up.

One of my work friends actually texted me back the night i tried to commit suicide. It was about what happened when i quit and had a break down. the text was short ""It's not your fault."" and that saved me. the other work friend still the same but at least says 'hi' when i walk in. I can do small talk but everyone is just quiet around me.

I want to talk to them more about my situation and depression but i don't want to drive them away or make them feel responsible for my well being, I hate to become a burden like that. There is still a lot of things i need to get off my chest and say to my ex but I don't want to corner him or make him feel guilty about what almost happened to me.

I have talked to some people trying to help get past my depression but almost everyone brings up God and god's plan. And that just infuriates me to the point of wanting to get physically violent with people. What kind of loving god would put his beloved child through hell and to the point of suicide to show you how much he truly cares and loves you. Reasons why I am an Atheist. or they just say 'get over it' like its easy to do.

Now it's almost the end of the month, rent is coming up but still no roommate with their half of rent. still no real chance to just hang out with friends Ex situation still Ugh. My depression is getting worst and now i have to deal with a lot more anxiety and paranoia than before. I want to leave this hellhole of an apartment because I am all alone here and the rent and utilities are far more than what i can afford on what income i have left. I can't leave because i signed a lease and the Property management says they need my roommates signature to release me from the lease And that won't happen 'til after she comes back. The management says that if my roommate doesn't return or doesn't pay her rent by this January they will help me out and get me off the lease. Not sure what will happen to the roommate or her stuff, I don't give a shit. she abandoned me and the apartment for all i care and left me with the full bills which totaled over/around $900 for the month not to mention the internet bill she didn't pay while she was still here which itself was almost a hundred, not in my name never had to worry 'bout it.

Right now i just really need a friend. not someone to coddle me or pat me on the head and tell me things will get better, but an actual friend. Someone who's not so busy to say hi or get mad at me or do something to get me mad but still be like bros or family, I'll even accept a narcissistic a*hole who's only there for me to feed his ego, Had one of those, he was still very cool a dick but cool. Humor works with me I've noticed, which i why i like to hang out with almost anyone.

Since my breakdown Dec. 8 I have lost my appetite, Iv'e lost weight almost 20 pounds due to the lost of appetite and due to the fact i have to save my money solely for my rent so i haven't had much to eat even when i could. I'm not physically ill with the flu or a cold or anything like that which is a plus.

For the first time ever i actually feel lonely. IDK, I started typing this after 15 hours of being awake, lack of sleep and irregular sleep hours are starting to happen, sorry if ti leads to bad grammar. I'll try to get some sleep It's a weekend. just felt like ranting but knowing that someone might actually listen to this is uplifting in its own way. would like advise, would like some help.

In June I'm graduating high school. Right now my GPA is a fantastic 1.8, and my guidance counselor told me I shouldn't even bother trying to raise it, or to try getting into college. I've had depression for a good portion of my life, and I honestly thought I had overcome it. I've been in a really good place the past few months but everything is crashing down again. I'll sit with my best friend while she laughs and makes fun of people who are planning on going to community college. I join in with her but it honestly hurts so badly. My mom asks what I want to do next year. In September I told her that I would like to go to college at some point and she just laughed at me. The other day I thought I was going to have a breakdown and spend hours in my room crying. But I didn't. I wish that I had. I felt nothing at all. I laid in my bed for hours in the middle of the day and couldn't even think about anything, I had so much stuff that I needed to get done. I've been there before but not in months.


My friend asked me where I had applied for colleges. I just laughed and said ""Oh, you know...."" she told me I would be stuck in this stupid town forever if I didn't apply anywhere. I was so close to breaking down then and there but I made up a stupid excuse to leave and went home, where I proceeded to do nothing. The next day she got accepted into her dream school. She has about a million travel opportunities just waiting for her and I really believe she could do anything she wanted if she put her mind to it. She told me ""It's cool, now we just need to wait for your acceptance letter"" I CAN'T GET IN ANYWHERE AND EVEN IF I DID I WOULD PROBABLY DROP OUT REALLY FUCKING FAST. I just can't talk to her about this and she is honestly the only person I'm even comfortable talking to about any subject heavier than the weather. I adore her, but our ideas of emotional support are completely different. I'm always there to listen to her, I'll sit and let her cry on my shoulder, if she asks for help I give it, when she wants advice I'll give it cautiously and you can bet your ass I'll be at her house in 15 minutes if she calls me needing help at 1am on a wednesday night. 

So why is it that I can't open up to her about anything? I've never talked to her about my depression, about my academic disaster, about how I have no idea what my sexual orientation is and that scares me more than it should, when the doctor thought my mom's cancer was back, about my shitty family, about how many times I've just shutdown, about how much I hate every single detail of my body, about how horrified I am of where my life will take me in the next year, about how much I wish I just didn't exist anymore. Because all she wants to do is fix my problems and tell me everything will be okay. Well it won't be but we can't talk about that possibility.

I want to travel, but everything I've read says that solo travel isn't a good option for people with depression and I don't haven any friends who would go with me. I want to disappear, but I could never do that to my little brother. I'm the only person in the world who treats him like a kid deserves to be treated. If I leave nobody will listen to him when he has a bad day, or bother to talk to the poor little guy about anything other than how disappointing he is (which he isn't. I'm incredibly proud of him, even if he is just a goofy 8 year old). But if I stay I will disappoint every fiber of my being. The idea of being in this town in 5, 10, 20 years from now breaks my heart, and I'm scared that if I don't get out of here after graduation that will be my reality.

I was on anti-depressants, anti-anxiety meds and sleep aids for a few months last year. I don't know if they helped or not, but I think they could have if my mom had let me continue working with my doctor. But she constantly forgot to pick up prescriptions that sat in the pharmacy for ages, wouldn't schedule doctors appointments and would tell me to stop taking ""happy pills"" and that I was the only one who could fix my problems. I would like to try them again but am scared to approach the topic with her, and I'm still 17 so there aren't many options I have.

I'm so fucking scared of what the next year will be like, and all this is just the tip of the iceberg. I thought it would feel better to type this all out, but it doesn't. I still don't feel anything. I don't even know why I'm fucking submitting this, but the idea of backspacing over the whole thing felt so wrong.",depression,t5_2qqqf,I'm scared things are getting bad again...

I was put on medicaid, I appealed the decision wanting to pay for health insurance but was denied.  I don’t know if this would work, but one of the reasons they claimed script was denied (even though it shouldn’t be) was because doctor was out of network.  If it’s anything like regular doctors and medicaid (I’m assuming it is much worse) I have to call a bunch of listed ‘in network’ psychiatrist, only to be told 90% of them don’t accept my insurance, and the 10% that do have two month wait time.
Step 3, get new insurance, which will probably take a month and hope they don’t fuck me over.

I hate him, I hate him, I hate him. I hate everything about him. I guess I was really excited at the prospect of making a friend, that I didn't notice these things about him. And I was going through ""girl trouble"" (which I've vented out about previously on here), so that blinded me even more.
Now I realize how much of a user this guy is. We became friends because we shared similar interests (in music). I honestly didn't like him that much at first, but I pushed through because I was in the process of fighting my anxiety, and that had to be done by putting myself outside of my comfort zone and talking to people. But now I realize how selfish this guy is.

When my crush unfriended me on facebook a day after I asked her out (long story. Won't go into it. Check my profile if you're interested), I was devastated. She unfriended him as well because she knew he was my friend. She barely talked with him to start with, but she was my friend, and he is my friend, so he added her on facebook and she politely accepted him. 
Now, knowing what I'm going through, you would expect my ""friend"" to comfort me and ask me about how I'm doing. You would expect him to ask me about her response after I asked her out. But no. Two days after she unfriended me, he messages me saying ""Yo! *Name* unfriended me! What did you say in that letter?"" He didn't even ask if she had said yes. No, he just went straight to himself. He was concerned about why she unfriended him, a person she barely knew or talked to. He wasn't concerned about what happened between me and my ex-friend and crush. He wasn't concerned about her response. He was just concerned about why she unfriended him and if I said anything about him in the letter.

The second he sent that message, I had a sudden clarity moment. This guy is selfish. He has always been selfish. When he invited me over to play guitar with him a couple of times, he would end up taking my guitar (it's a fairly expensive guitar, while his is a piece of crap) and playing with it all the time while I sat there and watched. He wouldn't give it to me to play until I asked for it, and being myself, I rarely asked for it. He would always ask me to wait for him, but when I asked him to wait for me for the first time, he just left. I called him twice, he ignored. I sent him messages asking where he is, he ignored. An hour later, he replies to the messages saying ""Yo Im home."" Great, I just waited for an hour looking for the sonuvabitch, only to find out that he couldn't wait for a few minutes for me. When I had a class, he would say ""so what? You can go late a bit."" And being me, this is a new experience for me and I was excited. I finally have a friend to hang out with! I'm in college so it's a bit late, but I can finally cut class, something which I never got to do in high school because I never had friends to cut class with. When he has a class and I ask him to go late just 5 minutes, he says ""no man I can't."" The goddamn bastard. He's Nepali. A few times, he took me to hang out with his Nepali friends, and he would start blabbing away with them in Nepali and I would feel left out and secluded. Why did he bring me here? I don't understand what he's saying. I'm just sitting here doing nothing. Every time, his friend would have to say to him ""Yo speak in English so he can understand."" He would say ""Okay"" and talk in English for a bit, then start blabbing away in Nepali and his friend would say the same thing again. 

And now, for the first time since classes ended, he messaged me saying what's up. I got excited. He messaged me! A friend messaged me! I guess he isn't as selfish as I thought. That's amazing. ""Not much. Just watching an anime,"" I said. ""Okay,"" he replied. ""Yo man can you send me your essay? I need to submit my essay by tomorrow night and I don't know how to write it."" **pokerface** After a few minutes, I sent him. ""No. I'm sorry I can't."" I've never said no to a friend before. This is the first time I do such a thing. ""I just need to look at the structure,"" he said. ""Nah, I'm sorry man. He'll know you took my structure. I have a unique style of writing. He'll know. You wrote essays before. Just write one,"" I said. ""I don't know how to write research papers,"" he said. ""You wrote the first draft. Just make it better,"" I said. He finally gave up and said ""Ok."" 

Now, I might be a douche bag and a pretty shitty friend for saying no, but I've had it with this guy. I can't take him anymore. He irritates me. I don't know what the point of this thread is. I guess it's just me venting out. Feel free to hijack the thread and share your opinions or experiences. I don't mind. ",socialanxiety,t5_2r22n,I made a friend this semester. I hate him.

Like, no AD ever made me feel happy. Opioids are the only substance I know that actually *induced* happiness, no matter how depressed I was. But ADs haven't done shit about my mood.
They allowed me to get shit done and they made me want to get shit done...So yes, I was able to keep going...But that was pretty much it...And I don't even know if it really was the meds...

this morning through afternoon i had what i could only explain as an awake dream.  i was asleep for parts of it, but i felt awake.  i looked around.

i was trying to figure out this place i had definitely gone skiing before with my friend chris.  we took a back road there, stopped at a grove because it was tradition despite feeling the need to move on.  You could get to the mountain via skiing from the top of this back road, and wouldn't have to buy a ticket until you got to the bottom to get on the lift.  I'm walking up the hill and i was trudging up a hill trying to keep up with some older gentleman.  I eventually see someone wearing my fathers clothes so I asked ""dad?"" and he turned around and it was him.  He told me to let him know if i needed help and then gestured behind him but he kept going.  i was out of breath and my legs were tired and i was about to give up, then i took the hand of my younger self who was about 5 walking in front of me.  i was weak and tired and he was young and strong.

it scared me because i was convinced it was real.  this wasn't like being in a dream asleep.

I've been having more ""awake dreams"" lately but this was the most vivid.  they started about a year ago.  i'd think that i woke up and looked at my alarm clock and thought i overslept and missed an important meeting at work.  my heart would race and id throw back the covers and get out of bed only to realize it was hours before i had to get up.

i've recently been ""awake dreaming"" that I've woken up and looked at emails on my phone only to see that i have like 30 unread ones and everyones mad at me because I've missed work.

However, if taken in moderation, neither of them is very self-threatening. In the case of alcohol, it's also legal (for those of at least minimum drinking age), just like morphine and other opioids or benzodiazepines.

The only difference I can see is that one requires a prescription and the other does not.

The reason I ask is because I, at *25 years old*, living on my own, told my dad and my step-mother that I've been drinking a little bit on a recent car trip, and they treated me like I was some sort of stupid, hopeless alcoholic. And they didn't believe me when I said my physician, seeing as she considers me intelligent and responsible, told me that drinking in moderation would be fine.

On top of that, all I drink is alcopops (Smirnoff Ice, which is like 4.5% ABV-- that's approximately 9 proof, which is incredibly low for an alcoholic beverage), and I hardly ever drink even a half a bottle (750mL) in one sitting, and I *never* drink more than once a day.

I have lost so much over this year, a lot of it at my hands due to being terrified and isolating from everyone and removing people from my life that were not good for me. Honestly, it is hard to be around anyone, like really hard and there are some people that I stay away from, or minimize contact with to protect them. I have flashbacks a lot of various traumas and my nightmares are awful. The last few nights I have fallen asleep and woken up freezing and sweating and crying, looking for the one person who I ""see"", the one person I connect with in this time of complete disconnect from the world. I feel like I'm floating above everything looking down, empty, dead, and detached from everything and everyone else, but this one person gets through and I'm so grateful for him. 

How is it that I went through all this stuff the first time around at various ages, from maybe even birth based on my mother's hatred/resentment toward me, and ""survived"" and even tried to build something for myself in spite of everything, but now I can't do anything, can't handle anything, am weak and suicidal and fragile and helpless???  (sorry so long)  Now, reliving all these events every day, reliving the neglect and absence of love and affection, the gaslighting from my abuser believing I was too sexual for my age and that I made him do those things, the shame and years of secrecy of my rape, the fear of very dangerous situations with my father and situations I put myself in later on, etc etc etc, it has taken ""me"" away. I am not the same person. I don't even know who I am. Nothing makes sense. I don't like the same things I used to. I rarely smile and laugh and play and that was a big part of who I used to be. I avoid people and eye contact and I used to find people fascinating (while still enjoying my time alone), which I don't do now. I'm scared of everything. I can't believe that this person in my life could possible love me and it terrifies me that I have allowed myself to have feelings for him and trust him and have opened up to him about everything. He knows all of me. It's so scary! 

Someone said to me that they would rather have my life than theirs. It made me think about how weak I am and how I used to pride myself on my strength and how I built something from nothing in spite of all I went through. But now that is completely different. I am a weak person. Maybe I should be able to handle what is happening now. Maybe if I was a better person, I wouldn't even have PTSD. Maybe there is something so wrong with me and I feel like I don't deserve anyone to talk to me or try and help me because I have no heart and am a coward and want to give up.  

I spent all night, after an awful couple days alone from these holidays. drinking beer and cutting. I destroyed myself. I'm angry with myself. I couldn't stop all the abuse back then and I can't stop it now. Except back then I just put up with it and tried to be happy and make people happy and not be a burden, and be a good person and just exist for other people forgetting my own needs and wants. I can't seem to do that anymore. I feel like a terrible, selfish, weak, useless person. I hate this. I hate who I've become. It is everything I tried so hard not to be.

anyway. i've always been an emotional person. it doesn't take much to reduce me to tears. i'm really embarrassed and ashamed about this. my parents are good parents but have always been of the ""stop the waterworks"" mentality. a lot of times when i get sad i also get really REALLY angry, and i feel like i don't have control over myself. i might say something mean, or try to guilt whoever i think ""caused"" my sadness, or just act in a way that makes me feel ashamed when i look back on it. like, why would i do that? why couldn't i stop myself? 

i have had two major relationships. my first boyfriend and i dated for 3 and a half years. looking back i realize i treated him pretty terribly. i would get really, really nasty with him when i was upset and then quickly regret it and cry a lot. my current boyfriend and i have been together for over a year now, and at first i thought my issues from my previous relationship were gone. but slowly they've crept up on me and it's causing a lot of tension between us, especially now that we are home from college on winter break.

for example, the other day my boyfriend had to work all day, and i couldn't find something or someone else to occupy my time. so i sat at home and let my thoughts consume me. i felt so worthless and alone, like my life had no purpose. i basically laid in bed all day and cried. at some point my boyfriend texted me saying we were no longer going to lunch with his mom and grandparents the next day since he had to work again. this is where i confuse myself. i don't like his mom. she is NPD and her behavior makes me uncomfortable. his grandma is also an N and just makes his mom worse. so no i really didn't want to go to this lunch. but somehow i still felt incredibly betrayed that he was going to work instead of sticking to the original plan. first i was sad, then i was enraged. for some reason i thought that my boyfriend was just going to work every day for the rest of break and i would never see him unless it was on his terms. and this made me really angry. so i decided to myself that if he ever did want to hang out i would just make up some reason i was busy and maybe it would make him feel guilty for working so much. i don't know. i look back on it and it seems really stupid. it seemed stupid like 5 minutes after i thought of it. and then i felt guilty about it and cried more. talking to him that night he admitted sometimes he feels i overreact or have emotions that don't really make sense. 

i guess i just feel really clingy and like i have no control over how i feel and it's just getting worse and worse. i saw my boyfriend for a little today for christmas, i will see him tomorrow to return stuff at the mall together, and i will see him saturday to go to lunch with his family. BUT i might not and probably won't see him sunday for when my family has friends over and this realization made me instantly sad, even though my boyfriend was sitting right next to me. he quickly caught on and i explained how i was feeling. he got really frustrated with me and himself and that conversation is still going on via text since he left.

a few other things, i have never really had a lot of female friends so now that i'm in college i've found friends among the girls who live on my floor. that's been going pretty well. i had a few instances where i thought they didn't like me and i cried for a while about that, but i also recognized it was my fault that since i tend to isolate myself for fear of actual rejection. logically i know it makes no sense and it's really a self-fulfilling prophecy but friendships are really hard for me.

i don't know if i would describe myself as incredibly impulsive. i do drink frequently and will smoke marijuana on a whim, even when i know it will probably make me feel terrible the next day. i used to self harm, but i haven't in years. although when i get to my really bad place i do get urges to start again. people also often point out that i am really hard on myself. my first math exam of the semester i didn't do very well. instead of buckling down and studying to improve myself, i wrapped myself in a blanket and cried for like two hours, feeling worthless and stupid and unfit to live. i knew i should've picked up a textbook and got to work, but i physically could not do it. i have never attempted suicide but i have considered it many times and found solace in the thought of my death.

i guess that's it. i know this was really really long but i hope someone here can please relate to any of it and offer any advice on how to cope, at least until i can get back to school and see a therapist there. like i said i don't know if this is actually bpd so if it sounds like something else please point me in the right direction. thank you.",BPD,t5_2qqdp,"feeling broken, wondering if i belong here?"

My obsession with her goes so deeply that I sometimes can't tell the difference between what I see and what is really there.

I can't help but hope that she still cares. I know it probably shouldn't matter, but she's all I care about. Tomorrow is her birthday. Knowing that just makes today harder. I want to say something to her so badly, but I probably shouldn't. I want my life back to the way it was.",depression,t5_2qqqf,I stopped talking to her forever ago and I stay obsessed to this day

I'm heartbroken over the whole thing. She'd gone through some agonizing surgeries and was being moved into rehab, and I wasn't there for her. In fact I hadn't seen her for a long time. She was such a big part of my early life and spent so much time with me. We did so much together. Grandma was what made my childhood bearable. 

Now she's gone, and my mother can't seem to grasp the concept that I'm sad over this. 

Christmas Day we had plans to go out for dinner, but of course as soon as I heard the news about my Grandmom I had no intention of going out. I needed time to myself to process it all. I made it abundantly clear to my mother I was not going out. I told her and my step father to go out and enjoy her gift of a meal out. 

""C'mon, get out of bed and get in the shower."" 

""It's still early, you can get ready and we can go."" 

""Are you sure you don't want to go?"" 

""It will be fun."" 

""It'll get your mind off of it."" 

 **No. I do not want to go out. You go. I am staying here.**

Finally they made their way out the door. I decided to climb out of bed and take a shower to try and clear my head. But of course I hear knocking on the bathroom door while I'm in the shower. 

""We're waiting for you!"" 

Are my emotions and requests not valid? Am I a joke? 

I pretty much had to scream that I was not going for her to get the message. 

""I'll bring you something back. What do you want? Soup?"" 

**I don't fucking care. I don't want anything!**

I almost said I wanted her to bring back my Grandmom, but of course she'd twist it to make it seem like I was being inconsiderate to her. 

Fast forward to today. I was feeling a bit better this morning. Got some fresh air and got our dogs out while it was quiet. Decided to use my new fondue pot for dinner, but we needed some stuff from the grocery store. We got the dogs back inside and my mother turned to me. 

""Now we need to go (30 min out of the way) to bring (Step dad) his lunch."" 

**I thought we were just going to the store?**

""Yeah, but I forgot."" 

All my motivation for going out left me as abruptly as it came. A while later we manage to get out to the store, and my emotions were creeping back up on me. Little things, like asking me what bread I wanted, were grinding on my nerves with more and more force. I wanted to run and hide in my room, to cry and remember my Grandmom. I gave one word answers, but I guess this didn't convey that I didn't feel like chatting. 

Finally we had everything packed in the car and we were about to go home. She looked out at some stranger in the lot. 

""Is that the lady that was behind us in line?""

**I honestly have no idea.**

She looked to me. ""You want to go home?"" 

**Yes! I would! I would really like to go now!**

""What, so you can play on your computer?"" 

I was stunned. I had no response. **Forget the fact that a fucking family member died. I just want to play on my computer apparently.**

You want to know how she took it? 

""Well, someone is cranky.""

Yes. It's not possible that I want to mourn my Grandmom, or that I miss her and I am sad. I'm just cranky, in a foul mood. This shit baffles my mind. My mother has done this to me my entire life. Never have I been sad or angry to her. I'm either tired, hungry, or cranky. I have the emotional output of an infant. 

The real sad part is that this isn't even the worst instance. 

Once, a few years ago, I was severely down. I was so depressed I was bawling and openly admitted to my mother I wanted to kill myself. Her response? 

""Just get some rest, you'll feel better."" 

**NO DOCTOR, NO SPECIALIST. APPARENTLY SUICIDAL THOUGHTS ARE SOLVED WITH SLEEP. WHO KNEW?**

I'm so tired of having my emotions invalidated. It's so exhausting I don't even know how to cope.

I just need that last push. To be honest I am lucky for having friends, I am sorry for the, having to deal with me, is not easy. For that I shouldn't have friends, no should pay attention to me. NO ONE.

I don't deserve friendship, I don't diserve love. What I deserve is this pain, what I deserve is a painful and slow death. I deserve those things. 

No I haven't kill anyone and no I wouldn't ever hurt anyone. I actually feel awful when I step on a spider without killing it, I have to go back and spare it from the pain I caused.

But I have don't bad thing... Bad things to myself... I am broken... I am crazy... I can't love myself, I just can't.

January 11 is my birthday. I don't want to get to that date. I have been in the same f*cking dark place the last 4 years, the last four 11 of January.

What will happen is not fun at all, I have been thinking about it for soooo long. 

But I am a coward, not as brave as someone who actually goes with it. Those people are brave I am just a coward who is waiting for dying. I truly feel like I deserve to get sick and die an awful death.

January 11 is probably not going to happen anything. But this pain is what I deserve.

It feels like it wants to anyway. This stupid facebook year in review shit isn't helping my problems. This year I learned what it's like to have an entire group turn against you, a group therapy program no less. I came out to my family about the rape that happened to me when I was 17 on a family trip. Since it was a family member my mom is the only one left actively talking to me. My own brother skipped calling on my birthday/Christmas because of the mess ""I created"". I know now that what happened wasn't my fault but that doesn't help when my own family won't talk to me anymore.

My in laws at first only knew about a second rape that happened when I was 22. They are hateful people but I'm stuck crying when no one looks and smiling when they are. They are convinced I'm lying and made it up because it happened post getting married while my husband was deployed. I think they know about everything now including my abusive father and grandparents. I don't talk to my dad and haven't for years. I had to skip my grandmother's funeral because I didn't want to risk him talking to me. She had actually called me several years back and appologized for how she treated my mother in front of me and how she treated me. In the end we were good and she knew why I wouldn't speak to my father and kept our relationship from him because she loved me.

I cry all the time unless someone is around and even then I just blame my hormones. I turned 30 this year and it wasn't my age that was hard hitting it was the lack of love around me. I even asked my friend to stay here with me when I found out she had plans but the new boy in her life was more important and I get that, I really do, but it doesn't make it hurt less that some boy she started dating 2 weeks ago ranked higher.

I've had suicidal thoughts for as long as I can remember. I think they started when my uncle died when I was in preschool. I know they got worse when my aunt was murdered when I was 7.  

I'm here posting now because in a short while I have to buck up and spend the afternoon/evening with my in laws at their house. I think their favorite game is to find something horrible from my past and tell me why I should just get over it. I mean I know that's not the case but the depression applifies everything. They do hate me and that's not in my head. They've said it to me but because my husband is going through his own military ptsd junk he finds his parents to be helpful and supportive, sometimes. They're mad at me because I don't try hard enough to make them like me and that because when they first met me I was happy and cheerful. They met me while I was in denial about what my cousin did and before the second rape which they think is a lie anyway.

I feel like I've become an emotional dump truck here and now I'm embarrassed because I used to be punished by my father for being anything but happy when around him. He and my mom are divorced and have been for a while.

I just feel overwhelmed but I can't really talk to anyone and I don't have another therapy appointment until next week at which point I start transitioning over to a new therapist because mine is moving. I have headaches all the time anymore and my doctors don't know how to adjust my medication to fix me.  They get it right and then 3 or 4 months later I feel like I'm in the shitter again. I don't work, I can't. I get panic attacks just being out in public. I often anymore end up smoking some to be able to leave. I don't drink but my neurologist had me drink to diagnos my tremors which worked but told me only that my brain is broken and I need a nice electric shock to it to fix it and have a brain pace maker installed.

I'm barely 30 and I have the life experience of a 70 year old. I've had several mental break downs this year and don't see it ending any time soon. I just want to know when it stops hurting so much.

If you read it all thanks. I doubt I'll hear anything because of this post since in the past my posts have gone unnoticed but I don't know, can't know. Maybe my dad was right, maybe I really shouldn't have been born.",depression,t5_2qqqf,I feel like giving up.
BadAccountant,,,1419976786,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2qutji/small_vent/,2qutji,True,1,False,1440993374,3,"Approx. 11 months ago tried to commit suicide couple of times. Everyday thoughts of killing myself came, it felt out of touch. This was going on for years, with periods where I wouldn't be able to cope, losing a lot of friends every time. 

I sought help after my attempts. Maybe anti-depressants don't help, but all I can say about them is that after two weeks the thoughts were gone. It felt impossible. Placebo like. I didn't think of suicide for 9 months after that. 

About a month ago I went off the anti-depressants feeling ready to deal with the suicidal thoughts if they returned. It was fine the first two weeks, but the old me is returning, which I am okay with, like I said, I want to learn to deal with it properly. Suicidal thoughts, anxiety, on edge, impatient, bipolar like feelings (4 up, 2 down day cycles), are the first things that come to mind.

I tried to make it clear to my parents that all of these things feel involuntary. I screwed some stuff up (happens mostly when I'm down), but I did't feel like giving up on life, I just couldn't get myself to stop thinking about suicide, it was making me feel crazy, although I feel I have it lightly compared to others.

They keep telling me to get myself straight and just get to work. I just played a bit of Pokemon Yellow for nostalgia, to cheer me up a bit, to wait till we all watch a movie together, and my mum tells me that I am wasting my life. It hurts a bit. My father told me today to not betray them by thinking about suicide. Which hurt a bit too.

I thought I explained it properly when I told them about my depression (hardest thing I have done in my life), but they treat it now like I lied to them about it. They travel but I ask them to stay as long as they can when they do come over (I'm in Uni), since their help means a lot and makes the difference between failing exams in a row and doing very well.

They seem to be having trouble to accept that the boy who they continually see making jokes and laugh all the time has periods where he life doesn't seem worth it and wished he wouldn't wake up once he falls asleep.

I am afraid that one day the feelings will be stronger than my fear of pain with the ability to complete what I start. It doesn't feel right to accept that I can succeed in suicide one day, but I have. I just wish my parents could understand why.

I haven't been able to properly express how I feel in this post. The anger has already subsided. I don't really blame anything on them.

I will post this either way, as typing this helped me and its a trend I don't want to stop.

Thank you if you read this, you are a good person to care for a stranger like me. I'll try to do the same for you.

I had a really awful childhood. Without going into detail, it was abusive and full of alcoholic maniacs. I was into self harm pretty bad. In sixth grade I changed schools and I remember the literal first time I saw my girlfriend. I remember everything she was wearing head to toe. I was not very social at all but I knew I loved her. We became friends and I stood by while she dated other guys, just waited. I got worse and worse. I almost killed myself once. A few months later I decided that I'd ask her out. She was finally single and I was tired of waiting. I knew for almost 5 years that I loved her and she was the one for me. If she said no I was sure I was just going to kill myself. Positive. That was all that I had to live for. Luckily for me she said yes and we dated for 3 years, the three happiest years of my life. We never really fought and even when we did it lasted only a few minutes before we got over it, maybe an hour max. We were the perfect couple. We just moved out to the same college together and just finished our first semester, doing great. She is extremely close to her family and the move was a lot on her. I, being completely the opposite, didnt understand and tried to help, wanted to help, but didnt know how. Now she has news that her dad has to move to North Carolina for work and her stepmom is pregnant. She feels like she's being replaced. Again, I didn't know how to help but I tried to be supportive and set her on the right path. I could tell that she was down but I didnt know how else to help. I'm fucking worthless when it comes to that, and just about everything else. We're on winter break so were home and I'm working as much as I can to save up some money before next semester. I had a day off yesterday so I thought we could finally hang out again. I'm not going to have many days off over break so I was excited. We went to grab a bite to eat and thats when she dropped this on me. We were having fun that day and everything so this was completely out of the blue for me. It couldnt have been more shocking. I never expected that in a million years. This is the girl that I plan to marry, that we talked about spending the rest of our lives together. I'm devastated and I'm really scared that I'm slipping back into how I was before I had her. I havent eaten or smiled since then. I spend all of my time when not working drinking nyquill and fucking bawling my eyes out until i fall asleep. I cant take this. I feel like I want to be dead but I could never kill myself. I try to stay asleep unless I have to work but I can't do that for long. She says we'll be back together but how can she know. She doesnt know whats going to happen.

Went on anti-depressants. Surprisingly effective in suppressing suicidal feelings/thoughts. I went off them recently. Wanted to learn to cope with it as suicidal thinking is nothing new to me. The biggest change I went through when on antidepressants was opening up to my family.

I am a University student. To help recovery I tried to quit as many 'addictions' (sugar/junk food, porn/masturbating, games, internet, alcohol, weed) and take on healthy lifestyle changes (gym, home cooked meals, going out, not skipping ANY classes). I have seen success in most, failing only when urges are too great which varies per addiction and change. I don't feel I would have been able to do all this without the antidepressants.

Over the months I went through bipolar like behaviour that it scared me, and I still have them. I learned to deal with them. Just wait it out. Don't screw up till I feel normal.

Last few days I have been quite tense and let me enjoy some of the stuff I used to, in other words, giving in to the urges. Light reddit browsing, coke, Youtube, masturbation, and Pokemon Yellow

My parents are telling me that I am wasting my life when they caught me watching videos and playing pokemon yellow. It hurts. The bipolar behaviour isnt helping. I feel very down.

I also have a tendency to not know when to stop when I start drinking. My plan was to tell my friend I was busy at last minute. I wish I stuck to that plan. 

I spent the beginning of the party sitting by myself because the anxiety was too much for me. I felt really left out but I don't even know what people talk about at parties. What if I start a conversation but then not be able to maintain it? It'll be awkward and embarrassing. What if I say something dumb? No one at the party understood this fear I felt that was paralyzing me from moving so I just sat there alone, looking like the weird guy at the party but whatever. I thought that was better than risking embarrassing myself.

When I starting to drink, I could feel my anxiety decrease slightly and I was able to move to stand near other people but I didn't much, if anything at all. I was pacing myself drinking so I wasn't feeling drunk at all but then I noticed everyone else was getting drunk and I felt even more left out.I become more sociable when I drink, so I started drinking more. Big mistake.

I don't remember what happened but my friend texted me in the morning saying he and his SO (the host) were very upset with me because I was harassing the other guests at the party. Apparently, I was very forward sexually and made other people uncomfortable.

I was so shocked. This was out of character for me, especially at a party. I didn't understand how it could happen. But then I thought about it more. I realized I was holding onto some jealousy of my best friend because he's much more attractive than me and is able to have sex with pretty much anyone he wants whenever he wants. He constantly is telling stories about his numerous sexual experiences. Who would want to have sex with me? The awkward, extremely short, slightly fat, transgender guy? I guess in my intoxicated mind, I wanted to prove I could be as outgoing and desirable as he is. 

I've only further ostracized myself. I didn't fit in at the start and I definitely don't fit in now. Not even with my best friend. I was hoping the alcohol would ease my anxiety but it's made me make a bigger ass of myself than I ever have before. ",socialanxiety,t5_2r22n,I want to crawl in a hole and die

For about 3-4 years now, I've been super depressed and anxious. I don't have many friends and I've never had a relationship before. When it first started when I was about 12-13, I assumed it was just a phase all teenagers went through since my body had hormones pumping around in it etc... After about a year of feeling this, I went to my doctor and she put me on meds and recommended me to a Psychologist. I saw the Psychologist a few times but found it really didn't help and the meds made me progressively worse so I came off of them and felt back to how I was. Everyone I've ever spoken to about the issue has always said; 'Do exercise, join a team, join a club.' But the thing is; I really hate sport, I do exercise at home by myself and have my own routine so by no means am I unfit, but I just really hate sport and I've never really know why. I've always tried to attempt it because it seemed like a good way to make friends and have fun, but it never was fun for me.

Anyway, into the present, it's all been pretty much the same except progressively worse. Still no relationship, still not many friends. I'd also like to add that when I talk about friends, I mean IRL friends, friends I can actually socialise face to face with, I have a few online friends who I treat like family because I've known them for years and we can always cheer each other up. Now onto my family. Pretty much, the only 2 people in my family I've ever been able to properly socialise with to a good extent is my brother (Who is 25) and my grandad (who has passed away). They always shared some sort of interest in games I play or just my life and if not, they can always make me laugh which is kinda a big thing since not many people IRL even see me smile. Before I say this, I don't mean this in a bratty teenager way. My parents haven't really done anything for my mental well being. I appreciate all the things they have given me like food and shelter etc... But I can never really express my appreciation because I have all these feelings on top of me, and when it comes to my mental well being, they don't really help much. When I first told them, they thought the same as me that it was a phase. However, they agreed to take me to the Psychologist and all that stuff. After that, they haven't really seem to take any notice or even care about it. I must add that my parents have a really bad habit of making arguments out of nothing. So whenever I ask them a question or try to have a conversation with them, it always turns into an argument and makes me feel a little neglected which makes me feel worse. (When I say always, I mean ALWAYS)

I'm also very socially awkward which makes it really hard for me to socialise at work and school. The big problem at this stage in time which make me feel a bit like shit is some of the people at school who I actually look up to because they are very, very good at socialising and are so confident with their speaking (They are literally friends with every person they speak to) are getting girlfriends and are heading to parties and things like that, and I just think, why can't I have something like that? A life with no mental issues, Someone I can care for and they can care for me back, idk...

Another thing to note is that I'm feeling somewhat like I don't really belong anywhere or have any meaning, like I'm an empty body, no emotions beside negative ones.

The tl;dr of it is that I feel much better and I feel different and that I'm no longer the person I was at the beginning of the semester.

Anyway, to the point of this thread. Today, I had to go back to campus to drop off a book that I had borrowed. It was the first time I go back to campus since the semester ended. As I walked up the staircase of the train station where I used to take the train with her, I got this uneasy feeling. When I got to the actual campus and walked under the arch where we stood, the bench we sat on, the side of the pavement where we walked, the building we had class in, etc. this feeling of unease turned into something else. Suddenly, I found myself looking around in nervousness (looking for her i guess? I honestly dont know what i was looking for and there are no classes in session so there's no logical reason for her to be on campus), hyperventilating and my legs could barely carry me. It felt like if anyone just touched me, that would've been enough to knock me on the ground. I even saw a girl walking in the distance who in hindsight looked nothing like her, but I kept nervously looking at her partly hoping that it's her and partly hoping that it's not. I don't know why this happened. I was positive I was over her. In fact, I kind of dislike her at the moment (or so I think). And more importantly, it has been a long time since I had any anxiety-related trouble because I actually believe I defeated it, or at least most of it.

This happened only an hour and a half ago but for some reason, it feels like it happened few days ago. I guess it's because of all the things that started running through my mind. If I get this every time I go to campus, I don't know how I'll be able to endure this feeling for a few more years. I don't know how I'll be able to go to campus every day when classes start again. If just the thought of her gave my that feeling, what would happen if I actually do bump into her (which is more than likely since we're both engineers and we both take the trains from the same station at roughly the same time).

EDIT: don't get me wrong, I don't think I still suffer from SA—at least not to the same extent as before. I'm now more than comfortable talking with strangers and hitting up small talk and conversations. It all became so easy and I'm so proud of myself. I seriously believe I defeated SA.

The hyperventilation, the feeling that my legs couldn't carry me, that my body was walking autonomously and my mind wasn't there, I haven't experienced that in such a long time.

Then I got fired because they said I wasn't a cultural fit fort he company. I had just gone to the Doctor and told them that I was feeling depressed for the first time. 

They put me on a medicine to help with anxiety attacks, but after I lost the job I lost the insurance, so I haven't really been able to get any since October.

I've just had to move from my home where I lived for 15 years of my life with my 2 brothers (1 older, 1 younger) and my mother to my fathers house. The move doesn't really effect me, its more of the fact that I am around and living with people who hardly know me. My uncle (dads brother) lives nearby and I've seen him like twice in my life and he is a pretty shitty person. Last time I saw him he and my dad had a punch up. My dad always bitches about him and compares himself to him. It is a very unhealthy relationship and I feel sorry for them. They are very similar, both cannot empathize and are incredibly judgmental if you have different interests than they do. For example; Gaming is my passion and rather than watching T.V I would prefer watching Youtube. But they (Meaning my dad and his brother) see that as the wrong thing to do and think Sports should be my passion and T.V is what normal people watch in their leisurely time. This all sounds very minor I know, but it does hurt me whenever they make remarks about me not ""getting out enough"" (what does that even mean?) knowing my uncle its going out clubbing every weekend. I'm just not that kind of person, nor do I want to be like him. When we all went to his sons school musical he talked down to me saying ""Whats it like being outside?"" in a real condescending tone and laughed in my face, I was humiliated and felt like complete shit for the whole night. Yet I kept up my facade. I'm not some shut-in either, I go out as much as I desire and usually play tennis every afternoon. Even saying that makes me feel like I am the one that has to prove myself. I feel like they are bullying me because they are unhappy, or just don't realize that they can hurt people with what they say. I've spoken to my Dad about it and he never understands and just repeats it. I am also very insecure of the fact that I haven't got a job yet. I feel like they think I'm some lazy slob that's just freeloading. Like when my dad gets back from work and asks what I've done today, it makes me feel dead inside like I'm useless and don't contribute anything. But the truth is that its on my mind all the time about what I could do I'm just nervous and unsure where to start as its new to me. Im sure once I do it will be fine. Its more of just feeling like everyones talking about how ""All he does is stay inside and play video games."" Once I get a job it will feel better so I could say to them ""Oh I gotta go to work."" or ""Yeh, I'm working."" I don't know if any of you can relate to what I mean by that. Its like when I was in school they couldn't really say I didn't get out much but now that I've graduated they just judge me 24/7 and I just want it to stop. Not once have they asked whether I miss my friends or life back in my old place (which I do, deeply) they just expect everyone feels how they do and have an inability to see things from another perspective. Also, my Dad is an alcoholic and gets drunk every night. He talks about nonsense when he is drunk to which I just pretend to acknowledge. No one dares talk to him about his alcohol problem, but when my older brother smokes weed my dad judges him to no end. I have tried to tell him how it is cognitive dissonance and hypocritical but whenever I mention the alcohol or anything in general bad about him he just gets defensive and gets really angry. Its like he doesn't see any faults in himself. Is it narcissism ? I don't like confrontations so most of the time I just nod whenever he talks about the weed and completely betray everything I believe in. It feels like I'm being held hostage by a madman and am afraid to step out of line. I know the rest of my family feel this too, its like we are extra nice to him and kiss his ass just so he doesn't get angry. It feels like any sort of affection I give is some kind of stockholmes syndrome. I am happiest and most productive when he is at work, its like the minutes before he gets home my throat gets all dry and my heart rate goes up. I get an overwhelming feeling of anxiety, its horrible. It just feels like this is some nightmare and I should be waking up soon, back to my old life with my friends and nowhere near these people. Sometimes when I'm alone I just take it all in and feel like crying or just stare at the ceiling, feeling empty inside. 

Sorry if I ranted on, I just typed what I felt as I went along. If anyone else has experienced something like this or can relate in any way, please tell me how you coped. I feel so alone. ",depression,t5_2qqqf,"Insecurity, anxiety and a few shitty relatives is a bad mix...."

I have the occasional mood spike where I want to take on everything and everybody, it at best lasts 24-48 hours.




But generally everday is a slow, gradual fight to keep going. working an eight hour day for about 50 bucks once all of the deductions and taxes are figured into it.




For what though?




I rent a place that I share with a roomate in an out of the way town in nevada.  




If you look at Maslow's Hierarchy of needs I am doing pretty good. I have air, food, water, protection from the elements. But thats really about it.




In an attempt to be more than the generations before me I decided to go into college. Which only steepened the decent and rendered the situation unrecoverable. 146 grand in debt, two degrees, one certificate later This is where I am.




I have the knowledge to do so much, but not the means or the mentality.




Born too late to explore the world, too soon to explore the stars.




The ""Education"" was deemed useless by those that would hire me. I now work a minimum wage job while watching others get promoted as I get demoted, waiting for the debt collectors to come, for what I do not know since I have no car, no assets, no family. 




I do have friends, but ive become such a burden to them. As the years went on I have kept in touch with them, just enough to see how they progressed with their lives. I dare not visit them out of fear of spreading my condition to them. (I know it doesn't work that way but this is how I feel) Anytime we talk I have to make up stories about how good im doing.




Friends have grown up, married, started families. Others have promising careers, wondrous adventures.




The vast majority of them have forgotten about me, but it is better that way. Better they know the person I was as opposed to the person I turned out to be.




I like to think that I run my life on logic, but emotions can warp logic. Sometimes  it takes somebody outside looking in to see how twisted it gets at times.




With all of these factors stacked against me, and with the sheer number of them being unrecoverable. (The interest alone on that much student debt is more than double what I make in a year pre taxes/bills) 




When a Situation becomes futile it makes sense to End the situation, there is no point for further extrapolation if the factors remain unchanging.




One would think that it would be easy to end things, Ive tried several times before. But it has never worked. Acquired Logic does not seem able to override programmed biological imperatives. The body strives to live, even though the mind realizes there is no point to do so.




Am I afraid of death?




I don't think that I am.




I think I am afraid of non-existence, that moment when the electrical impulses that make up who you are fade beyond the point of recovery.




I have never done drugs, and by drugs I mean substances not obtained by a prescription written for me by a licensed professional. The whole drug free mentality was burned into me at an early age. Despite the fact that people who do them are often in a better place than I am on a fairly consistent basis. In hindsight I think its more of a moderation issue than an abstinence issue.




I sometimes wonder when Ill be able to complete the equation. 




I feel that im working towards something, what is and how im working on it I have no idea. I also don't know how close I am to finishing it.




But when I do I feel that then I can be free of this farce.

I didn't say that i had not smoked i thought i will be punished because we were in the girl's toilet... I was the shy, lame guy and i think i had social anxiety. Back then i started a really bad habit, to masturbate on porn, a lot, still have it...

Then i got go college to study computer engineering. I had friends, studied reasonably well. I loved being at college, but in my hometown my friends bullied me verbally, but i stayed with them they were my only friends at home. I was afraid that i say something and they won't call me back etc. At college i was funny, happy lived well, then everytime i got home i was the nerdy, lame socially awkward guy. I forgot to mention that i was playing a lot of WoW that time. Then time got by and i started to use drugs. I studied less but looking back i was just cramming the words, and didnt comprehend them. Somehow i managed to get till my final exams, but never got there. At college and never had a girlfriend because i thought the girls who liked me were ugly. During that time i developped a narcississtic personality, and when i'm not controlling myself i can be a total a**hole. Sometimes i act like i'm being nice but in my mind i got evil thoughts and i don't like them.
At my last semester i tried LSD and had a very bad trip, smoked a lot of spice in spite i felt awful and had some panic attacks. I didn't knew back then that they were panic attacks. I know i'm dumb. Sometimes i lost touch with reality, had crazy thoughts night and day, i didn't know what was happening to me. I couldn't talk to my parents or anybody, i was afraid, i felt shame. Maybe i got OCD. In college there were times when i thought i had an illness , got online and read many sites about them and felt anxiety. I developed fearing from studying, fearing from everything. After i got home from college i lived a hedonistic lifestyle. Doing drugs, not working, just playing on my computer. It got worse day by day. Smoked a lot, felt anxious all day, months, years got by while my typical day would seem like: get up, 3 cigarettes, porn, cigarette, anxiety attack, porn, cigarette. reading about illnesses(and i believed that i have them, and got symptoms), while having anxiety and probably depression. As time went by i noticed that, i can barely focus, have bad memory, forget things, i was not the same person that i used to be. 4 years passed since and i didn't get anywhere.  In 4 years i worked for nearly 6 months. In 4 years i got to the point when i hate myself, always doubt myself, my memory, my own thoughts are against me. I hate the fact that i'm fucked up on so many levels(afraid to talk to people, not having people skills, i'm lazy, addict, can't feel love for my family and for myself), that i can't take it anymore. Now as i'm writing this i doubt that i'm making understandable sentences. I hate the fact that i didn't have a plan for my life, and fucked up my mind and myself. I'm having suicidal thoughts for nearly 2 years. I hate my personality, that i developped during these years.  I always beat myself up for not getting help earlier, and i didn't took care of myself. I just wanna leave this world...

I am a 17 y/o male that is fairly attractive (not my words, nor my moms. And this comes into play later), but please do not take age into consideration while forming a response. Before I begin, I would just like to say I have autism, which is very slight. No one knew I had it till I went for psychiatric testing due to my really depression. This combination of anger, sadness and obsessiveness gives me the exact same symptoms of a sociopath. Im not violent (yet), and I have great control over my actions (for the most part). I have a therapist and a psychologist, and I tell everything to my therapist who helps me sort through my problems. She has not really helped me with this one though, so before you respond ""Get help before you do anything"", know that I am already trying. I would also like to say, that although many people will probably say I should not even be thinking about relationships right now...this is who I am. I have accepted that I am this way, and will most likely be for a long time. So along with getting a job (which I have done) and finishing school (which I am working on), I need to continue advancing with relationships as well. I cant stand still. I need to march forward.
Whenever I fall for someone, it is much deeper than a crush. Much, much deeper. I emotionally invest myself in them, and basically obsess about them 24/7. I dont mean if I see someone I think is attractive this happens, but it develops over a period of time until they are the only person that matters.
Now there is this girl (A) who I adore. She is attractive, has the exact same interests that I do, and is a little bit insane as well (like me :D) She also has a great sense of humor. Now I have become emotionally invested with her, and care about her more than anything. I would do anything if she asked me too, as long as it did not involve betrayal between the two of us. Anyway, I would find myself glancing over at her from time to time, and noticed she was glancing back. This is usually a sign of interest, and it was not just from me peeking at her occasionally (I do it very subtly so she does not notice), but my friends have told me she looks at me a lot, or looks like shes struggling not to. I had my friend ask a friend of hers if she was single, since I did not want to involve myself if she was taken. This friend went and told A that I liked her (I didnt expect it, even though I should of) and she reportedly said ""Ew"". I was confused, because of the continuous glances she would still give me. I do not believe it is a matter of attractiveness, or maybe it is. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. But I did not give up.
This went on for a while until the eventful day where I learned my friends are assholes. Well, they are not, but they did an asshole thing. They saw that I was still obsessing about her, and forced me to go talk to her or they would. I refused, so they went ahead and told her all my feelings about her. I was really infuriated. I would be emotionally devastated if I was rejected (which I apparently was), and refused to talk to her (a huge mistake looking back). I just kind of ignored it...I did not really trust my friends anyway at this point. And yet again...still the glances, no different at all from before.
Now there was the homecoming dance. She went with her friends, but they went to get drinks and she was alone. She looked kinda sad and lonely, and was looking at me a lot. My friends told me that by doing this she was asking for me to talk to her. And as much as I wanted to take the chance (and my friends pushing me) I just couldn't. I was too scared of embarrassing myself and fucking up. I have depression...so I dont want to feel that kind of unbearable emotional pain that I would feel from rejection (I cannot dance for the life of me)...which is now one of my biggest regrets. Because here enters this guy (C), and hes a real asshole. I guess I did not mention it before, but shes a junior...and hes a freshman. I did not know him at the time, but after she got back with her friends, she was dancing with him. (Also there was still glances, even while dancing with him.) I was angry...but I accepted it, considering it was my lost opportunity. They left with his arm on her shoulder. I was really bummed, but I got over it. Let me just say a little bit about C, now that I know about him (not just my own personal interactions with him, but also I asked many other people that I hardly knew, and I got the same kinds of responses.) He is basically a player and a ladies man. Every girl he talks to seems to love him, and what really sealed the deal was that he has been reported for sexual harassment.
They were together a lot more now, and obviously suspected they were dating (still the glances). I was really depressed and angry, but it was better than flat out rejection. I just waited it out...(still the same old staring).
It got to the point where I just realized I needed to move on. It was hurting me too deeply. So I met this really nice girl at a metal concert I went to. I got her number, and decided that I would set my mind on her. It worked for a little bit...but while my mind was on this concert girl, my heart was still A's. I decided to start taking action. I asked my friend (whos good friends with her, but very trustworthy.) I asked if C and A were dating, and he said ""No I dont think so"". So I decided that before I go out with this girl I met at the concert, I would confront A for the first time. I got the opportunity during a 15 minute break time we have occasionally (its a private school,) and decided to confront her myself. No friends, no bs, just my feelings. It took a lot of courage on my part, and was nervous as hell. But I did it. I found her and...well, she was with C. They were just walking together, so I went up to A and just said ""Hey, can I ask you something?"" She saw where it was going and said ""Yeah...lets go this way C"", but he turned around and said ""Well bro, if you wanna ask her out, dont even think about it, shes mine."" Then he started laughing, and she laughed with him as they both walked off. Now I was not hurt. I didnt feel pain at that time. I wasnt sad. I did not feel anything. Then, the fires of hell came fuming into my body and I was more angry than ever before. I wanted to beat him up there an now...but I held myself back. Here was this slightly taller than me, slim as fuck freshman, breaking my heart for A. After all the effort I put into talking to A, he rejected me for her. Thats why I say hes a douche. Thats why I say hes an asshole.
I have been pissed off ever since, and now just ignore her. But guess FUCKING what...she still stares. Still looks at me. Maybe shes doing it all the time to mock me. But it doesnt stop. Its only me. She does not glance at anyone else like she does me. Every day im just angry all the time. But no matter what I try, I cannot get over her. Ive tried everything: ignoring her, talking to her, giving hints, making moves, even messaging her on facebook. But nothing has worked.
I cant have her...and at the same time I cant let go of her. Its destroying me. I really need advice on what I should do...I want her so bad, but I know I need to let go. I cant take being in the middle anymore...I need one or the other.
Also, if someone can also tell me why she keeps on staring at me, that would be great. It sends mixed messages.",depression,t5_2qqqf,I need advice...

I even find myself looking forward to things in the future, and want to do stuff to improve myself.

However, the one thing I can't seem to shake off is the suicidal ideation. I've often seen suicide as a means of escape if things get too bad, and on heated occasions in the past I've come close to doing it. Plus lots of plans and graphic thoughts.

etc etc

But here's the thing...even now, when I really don't feel at my lowest, I find the idea of dying remarkably appealing. Even though there's lots to enjoy and do, I feel that I've seen enough of life, and I want to get off the ride now. I watched a film earlier and I felt envious of every character who died...it seems so peaceful. I love the idea of not having to worry.

In short, what I've got at the moment is what I might call 'passive' suicidal ideation - no specific plans. I guess I'd like to be dead, but I don't want to die. My dream is to have some medical condition where the doctors say ""we're going to have to put you into a coma for several years"".

From then, I feel like the depression has suddenly come back. The loss of motivation, energy and even interest in sex is just so prevalent. It's different this time however. There are days where I would be extremely happy and motivated and so many things would race through my mind, but that last for about 5-7 days, and then I just sink into this deep depression where I can't get out of bed or shower or eat.

Becoming a teenager clicked wrong with me.  Something in my brain or something never clicked right, and ever since around the time I've turned 13, I've had issues.  In my attempts to understand what was happening with me, my rather limited resources (I'm an IT person, not a psychologist or psychiatrist or whatever, after all) led me to thinking I was experiencing depression - unfortunately for me, before ever going to my parents or any responsible adult, I listened to my slight elders (upper teens/lower 20s) that I was ""just going through a teenage phase"" and ignored help.

10 years later, I'm still ""going through a phase,"" I guess...but I'm finally about ready to get help; however, I'm in the fledgling stages of my career (I hit one year of experience in a month as a programmer), and I'm kind of afraid...for several reasons.

I'm afraid that, if I do get help, my history of self-harm and past thoughts of suicide (no attempt on record, and I don't really think towards suicide anymore) can cause inpatient treatment, which by itself scares me...and scares me for my fledgling career...programming is my passion, and I'm afraid that screwing up doing my passion as as career (one of the few things I enjoy in life currently, outside of the one friend who has been there for me for the past 5 years or so).  Conversely, I'm also afraid that if I don't seek treatment, I'm going to wind up losing my job or worse anyways.

I'm afraid of being dismissed immediately as ""not actually mentally ill.""  This particularly makes it hard to want to seek treatment, as I'm so sure that's what I'd hear.

I'm afraid of seeking treatment causing me to have to share with, at least my immediate family, the truth of my possible mental illness.  For that matter, I'm afraid of ANYONE finding out the truth...outside of my one close friend, no one that knows me knows.  I work so hard to make it look like I'm fine on the outside...I don't really want to let that facade slip.

Possibly most perverse of all, I'm afraid of actually getting better.  I've been like this since I started becoming a teenager - I don't know anything different.  This, alongside with the figurative voice in my head (I'm not LITERALLY hearing voices) telling me that I shouldn't waste people's time with my non-issues, that there's no way I'm actually mentally ill, and that if I AM ill, I probably deserve it anyways.

Prudes. Real or perceived, they're everywhere. I'm a 30 year old male virgin, and I blame it entirely on prudes. Never had a first kiss either. Yes, I may or may not share some of the blame for my issues, but I still refuse to acknowledge it.

I've spent literally my entire life around them. Whoever says the US is the horniest nationstate ever is deadly inaccurate, in my experience. Mere milliseconds of frontal nudity will have instant bombs dropped on the poor country that gave us that image on tv and US boots on their soil for the rest of eternity. Far worse reactions than the worst Middle East nations. Yes, I'm blatantly exaggerating, but it's too late to remove this ""everyone hates sex/nudism"" mentality from my head.

Right now, my perception that the world at large hates it, is especially focused on females, and that contributes to my depression like you wouldn't believe. Yes I like looking at them, yes I look away like I'm supposed to. But with the way my life has turned out and my constant observation of society around me, mainly from TV news and online media, the perception that ""women hate sex. period."" is so deeply ingrained into my psyche, that I literally cannot fathom it to be any other way. The most prolific of sexually active women ever will literally never be able to remove this mindset from my solid-stone brain. Pornography actresses or even prostitutes will fail even more, since my perception is that they're only in it for the money, and don't really enjoy it.

I already suspect that I will have an impossibly difficult time enjoying sexual activity, if I ever manage to engage in it in the first place. My chronic anhedonia and life-time pessimism will certainly make it worlse. I will find it exceedingly difficult believing that a partner will be enjoying it, even when we're in the middle doing the deed. And considering my sexual tastes are rather vanilla to begin with, in that I only like one other position that isn't missionary, and unfortunately for me, I learned it is quite unpopular with women to begin with, even if the subreddit dedicated to it that I lurk seems to imply otherwise. So as a result of that, and my pre-existing shyness and introversion, in addition to my huge body-shame and self-esteem/self-confidence issues, I just choose not to put any real effort into finding a partner.

And my living situation certainly doesn't help. No car, no license, stuck in a dead end fast food job, stuck in a group home, etc.

And what sucks is that I'm also a huge hopeless romantic; while I like the idea of multiple partners, I find myself preferring very much the life-time monogamy bit, as well as raising a biiiig family. My folks have been actually happy together for longer than I have been alive, and I have numerous siblings, and so that has rubbed off on me. Lol, no pun intended.

But for now I have something to share with you, my thoughts on all of this. Inbetween those numerous destructive thoughts one idea did form in my head. I may not know what to do, how to get out of this mental cycle, but I have come to realize that we are stronger than people think.

I realize this might be counterintuitive, I'm stuck, we're all stuck. 1 step forwards, 2 steps back, but I'd go as far to say that we are some of the strongest people out there. It might sound weird saying that, but think about it for a second. How many of us would rather deal with a near death experience over depression (me), get a lifelong condition like diabetes which will be a nuisance (me), or even a major event like a heart attack or stroke (me). 

Why would we rather deal with these things than depression...because they would be easier than depression, and for the most part they have a well defined set of causes and solutions. This is completely setting aside the fact that mental illness also brings a massive stigma attached to it whereas any of these would bring simpathy. Lets face it, we are dealing with something which in all likelyhood very few people have a deep understanding of it, and with even fewer people if any knowing how to damn well solve the bloody thing. We are fighting an unknown entity, we are fighting a wisp of smoke hiding in the dark and all we are armed with is a small portion of our brains. This isn't mind over matter, this is mind vs. mind, and to boot, your mind vs. your mind.

So know what? We are stronger than people think we are, because despite humanities primitive understanding of depression we keep fighting against an enemy that knows our weaknesses and knows us better than anyone else, we are fighting ourselves.

I was freeloading at my brother's place, helping pay rent with bond money that was meant for college. My alcoholism was going full throttle at the time and I had planned to slowly drink myself to death. I met her on World of Warcraft, and she took interest in me. We got closer and closer emotionally and eventually, physically. I thought she loved me, and I guess she thought so, too. I went back to college with the help of financial aid, and have been struggling with it for 2 years now. I am an idiot that simply has too much trouble focusing to actually do this. The girl of my dreams was more distant than ever, and she finally decided she was going to cheat on me. When I found out, I decided to stop drinking and get my life together.

I had moved out of her place, but left my things behind as she had told me we were just going to take a break from the relationship while I got my life together. She used this opportunity to fuck another man in our bed. And it was at that point that I realized that she never loved me. From the moment I moved in with her 4 years ago, she had been waiting for something better to come along, allowing me to believe that there was someone who actually wanted to be with me. I was just another burden for the last 4 years, and I still am, as I sit here typing from my parent's house, living rent free until I move back to get my shit from my ex in 4 days.

Knowing that she never loved me back, and that no one ever will (in an intimate sense) hurts too much.

My freshman through junior year of high school I tinkered with various forms of self injury. I started getting crippling panic attacks when I was 15. My senior year I finally got on an antidepressant that worked. Somewhat. I was getting by, but I wasn't happy. I was still having panic attacks.
Then I met him. There was an extra credit screening of Argo after school to which we could bring friends. I had no idea who this cute guy was offering me Oreos, and, convinced he was way out of my league, I kept refusing his offers because I didn't want to embarrass myself by getting black gunk in my teeth. He took me to my first prom. He was only a month older than me, but started school a year late, meaning he would stay home while I went to school 4 1/2 hours away.
I thought we were different. I thought we could make it work. We both did. I thought we were so in love. He talked about marrying me, would ask me what kind of ring I wanted, the house he would build us, the pets we would have. He graduated early and took as many credits as he could to catch up to me. He made my panic attacks better. He understood. Once, he drove me home in the dead of winter and let me roll the windows down to get some air because I was panicking. He never complained about being cold.
Last semester was tough. I was working two jobs, one of which was 4 a.m.-9 a.m. followed by classes or on the weekends which kept me from coming home and seeing him. He was my one motivation to get my degree and make something of myself, and not being able to see him was taking its toll on me. I was more negative, I just needed him to tell me it was going to be okay, that he was still there, and I had no idea what that was doing to him.
He seemed distant when I got home for winter break. I thought it was because he just got a new gaming computer and just hadn't figured out how to balance his new toy and his girlfriend of almost two years being home. This conversation turned into him saying he couldn't do it any more. He couldn't do the long distance. He said we were living two different lives, which still makes no sense to me, because he was and is my whole life. My reason for everything I do. At some point I said something to get him to change his mind, I asked him to keep trying and he said okay. And I don't know what happened. He said I want a boyfriend who is compassionate and understanding and he just can't be that anymore. He said he can't understand the things that get my down, but all that ever got to me was feeling incredibly alone on a huge campus while I was away from him.
The worst thing he said is that his well has gone dry. I and my negativity sucked everything he had to give out of him. I thought I was giving him everything, but it wasn't enough. I don't know how to express to him that I am so sorry for treating him so badly, and that I can and will change if he just gives me the chance. All I want, all I need is for him to change his mind. I feel so stupid for believing that someone as perfect as him could love someone has broken and terrible as me.

I had to work 80 hours last week because everyone else decided to take the holidays off (I didn't; because the idea was that everyone was going work then).  80 hours of working requires that i barely sleep - because 50% of my awake time is non-functional confusion / fatigue / staring off into space regardless of whether i sleep or not.

Donated it, lost lots of info and $750.

Need to go to a rheumatologist and tell them that the past dozen doctors I've seen have given me bullshit reasons for why i have double vision.  Can't find time.

Had my first ""day off"" since Thanksgiving, and I slept for 20 hours straight.  I've had other ""days off"", but I've spent them delusional (the day before Christmas) or otherwise dysfunctional.

Parents finally decided they wanted to come down to help - but what are they going to do?  Live my life for me?  Could bring me to a doctor, but so far no one understands my symptoms and i'm apparently too confused to notice that until it's too late.

This is beyond frustrating, all i can do is quit my job (only decent thing in my life) and beat my head against doctors, off myself, or continue this erratic psychotic and therefore pointless existence of complaining about it on the internet.

I looked up some ideas online, and what I basically did was use my shoe lace to slide it through the corner of the door to crack it open a bit. Then I used the radio antenna that I screwed off the car to try to reach the button, but it wasn't long enough, and I couldn't get a big enough crack with just shoe laces. 

I kept messing with my car until I realized one of the back windows was slightly open, just enough for me to get my hand through to the trunk in the back. I was able to get a coat hanger and a crow bar that was conveniently there. My dad owns a dry cleaning company, so we always have random hangers lying around. 

I used the shoe laces to get a crack, the antenna to enlarge the crack, and then the crowbar as a wedge. This gave me enough space that I could take the coat hanger, elongate it, and use the hook to unlock the door. Took a few tries, but it worked.

I've always bought planners at the store but right now, since I have some free time, I'm going to make one from scratch using a notebook. I like doing little arts and crafts stuff, and I'm thinking this time if I take the time to make a planner with all the days and weeks and months of the year maybe it'll give me a small wake-up call about all the days and opportunities I'll miss if I stay in bed like I did last year. 
I don't know if it'll work. But that's depression, you have to try new things hoping that maybe something will work. It seems every morning before I get out of bed I have to give myself a little pep talk, muster up a little bit of hope, and it's so hard to keep that hope up until the end of the day. It seems every night it's a struggle to not lose every little bit of hope I tried to muster that morning. But anyway. I'm going to try again, as a new semester of school starts. 
Does anyone have any tips? I'm just really hoping to hear from people who are going or have gone through the same thing. I'm looking for tips and tricks that might have helped you but I guess I'm also wanting to hear that I'm not alone and that maybe there's some hope. I just try to be OK every day, to do the bare minimum like get out of bed, bathe, eat. Some days I can't even to that. And then I take a look at the stuff I need to do, the homework and the meetings, and I get so overwhelmed to easily and so quickly. And the semester has barely started, I know it's gonna get so much harder.

EDIT: On top of that, I've been suspecting for a bit that instead of ""just"" having clinical depression and anxiety as I've been diagnosed, I might have some ""mild"" form of bipolar. Which makes me lose hope more, because sometimes late at night or really early in the morning I'll get the feeling that I found the key to solving all my problems and I'm gonna start doing every really early and I'll finally be on top of everything and do an awesome job and go above and beyond. And then I'll set everything up, I'll fill my calendar with so much detail and precision and mark all my books I need to read and sound out all the emails I need for my meetings. Then, a week later, I'll be in bed again not wanting to live anymore. So it just seems the more hope I have when I feel better, the harder I'll crash ",depression,t5_2qqqf,"Share tips and tricks to be more organized, accountable, responsible during a depressive episode?"

The past month it seems like things really have gone down hill. My biggest problem being lack of interest. I honestly have no clue what to do with my free time. My hobbies provide no joy. I tried walking and working out, but that doesn't help. I just do chores for fun, then sit there doing nothing whatsoever. 

On New Years Eve, my in laws and I had a little spat, and I drank a lot and took some prescription meds as a really stupid way of coping. (I drank 7 beers and took 4 Oxycodones if you're curious). Quite honestly I didn't really feel ""high"" or drunk, so it didn't help much anyways haha. Just lots of gas. Was it a suicide attempt? I don't honestly know, but I don't really think so. 

This lack of interest is a terrible feeling. What do you guys think? Does it sound like depression? Does it just sound like a bad time?

I just want you to know that we will do this! I have gained more hope because something happened that I only can dream of.

A little background: my best friend and I have known us for 3 years now and I have a few issues I have dealt with that I did not want to tell her until yesterday. I often think about her in a romantic way without wanting it. Something that bothers me for a long time now. 

So, yesterday we met and I wanted to be honest with her because I never lied to her. I told her everything. That I often think about it and also am curious about her scars. I want to see them because I want her to be free near me. I know that she is a person, who never judges another, but sure I was very afraid of her reaction. I was crying the whole time and could not look into her eyes. At the end, I lifted my head and saw this big smile in her face. I asked her, why she was not mad and she just said that she is there for me. Another thing is..She thought it is cute and is happy to hear that. I also told her that I am afraid I would again selfharm..What did she say? ""Don't be afraid, I am here and if something happens, call me. Remember, you are not alone.""

What?! 

So today I thought about the things from yesterday, trying to process everything and now I am sure that everything will turn okay after so many years. Sorry, just wanted to tell someone. I hope it was not long and that someone can relate to these feelings.

Take care and be yourself  <3",BPD,t5_2qqdp,There is a Light!

I am at the lowest point in my life than I've ever been. I'm so depressed that doing almost the simplest task takes a lot of willpower. Lately, I've been having suicidal thoughts because I have no idea what to do anymore.

I currently live at home and work at Walmart, despite having a BA in Asian Studies and being 26. Everyday I go into Walmart, I die a little on the inside. Seeing all the low-class people with no manners and the lifeless warehouse-look of the store further drives me to want to kill myself. I'm constantly treated like an idiot and like I'm still in high school (it doesn't help that I look significantly young for my age). Some days, I just want to throw the items I'm ringing up right into an asshole customer's face. I know how fucked up that sounds, but I'm so frustrated by my life that it feels like any big action, no matter how negative, would at least make me feel alive again. Working there, my self-esteem has plummeted right to zero. I don't even drive myself. I have to rely on my dad or someone else to drive me to work. It's killing me that I have to force my dad to drive me back and forth from this hellhole.

I don't even know what I'm qualified to do. As an Asian Studies major, most people expect that I would speak a language, right? Well, while I do know some Japanese, I don't know enough to really get by. I've been studying on and off, unfortunately, and while I did well in Japanese in college, it hasn't done much for me in getting better at it. 

So, having said that, I don't even know what that leaves for me. Every job I look at either says I need a degree in another field or I need several years of experience, despite it being an entry level position. I've also been on several interviews, and every time, I end up not getting the job. And getting the energy to write cover letters gets harder and harder because I feel like with every word I write, I'm lying to myself and the employer about who I really am. And posting on /r/jobs hasn't helped at all. There always seems to be that one guy who says ""why did you even major in Asian Studies?""

I was going to teach English at a language school in Japan, but I ended up chickening out at the last minute. The manager seemed like he would offer me to come at a later date, but I haven't heard back from him in almost a week. My one ticket out of this hellhole and I even fucked that up. Maybe I belong here and to have my self-esteem constantly wringed out by the redneck and ghetto clientele at Walmart.

I haven't even spoke with any of my friends in almost two years. I'm so ashamed of my situation and from looking at Facebook, they all have jobs now. And they're younger than me.

I wonder if ending it all would be the best course. I can't even go out and do anything fun because Walmart constantly fucks up my schedule to the point I can't go to any Meetups to meet people. And as for dating, well, what girl would want to date a guy who lives at home and works at Walmart? It certainly doesn't help that I've never had a girlfriend and I'm a virgin.

I just don't know what to do. And I may have even fucked up my prospects in Japan. I'm not entirely sure, but I think if this one job doesn't go through, it'll be on my record that I had a job in Japan that I never went to, and it will be harder for me to find future work there.

So, I have no idea what I'm going to do at this point. It looks like no matter what direction I try to take, it's game over. Looks like I should either get used to ringing up ignorant people up at Walmart for the rest of my life or end it all.",depression,t5_2qqqf,Depressed to the point that I can't even do anything

Lately things have been great. After two or three years I've finally landed a job that i enjoy and that I feel comfortable at. But now I'm sitting in dread. I'm worse than all others that were hired with me. I'm behind. I may get fired for not making the cut tomorrow.

Whether it be my family, my friends, coworkers, SO, etc. It doesn't matter.

""Those people don't want to hang out? They secretly hate you. They hate the shit out of you, man.""

Prudes everywhere, single folks nowhere, old farts everywhere, millennials nowhere. Nearby binary metropolis voted most shallow, judgemental single folks in the nation.

Maybe I focus too much on relationships (be they serious romance or casual naughtiness), but even then I realize I still will never be happy, with or without such relationships.

It doesn't help we have jerks like DeGrasse Tyson ruining things for us Space Opera FTL fans. Not to mention he Plutoed Pluto.
And my social anxiety holds me back from leaving the house for actual, non-work related social stuff as much as I need to. I get help from a therapist and other mental health workers, but they can only do so much. My social anxiety also cripples me from being able to approach a person (anyone, regardless of gender) to apologize if I realized I made a mistake or transgression. And my social anxiety also contributes big time to my social awkwardness, as can be expected.
On top of all that, serious self-esteem issues and body shame have had me decide to just not put any real effort, either IRL or online, into finding a partner, romantic or otherwise, since hey, there's no point to it and just not worth it, considering the impossibly-high preferences of the demographics in/of my area.

I hate myself for still wanting to be with someone who hurt me and hate myself for not just getting over things and getting better. I hate that I can't even successfully kill myself.

Anyway, here's an introspection of how living - I rather call it 'surviving the day' - becomes a burden when you're depressed.


Suddenly you start to lose sense in the things you do. You don't feel joy or pleasure anymore while doing the things you've always been so passionate about. 
You procrastinate from day to day, from one reality-escape to another.


The camera I used to take hundreds of photographs with, is lying somewhere in a cabinet, full of dust. Piles of books are lying on the floor. I bought them. Got them as a present. Never read any of them.


Expired gift vouchers for skydiving, a gourmet dinner and for a movie night (for two) are hanging at the pinboard.
Little wooden souvenirs from all over the world that my girlfriend brought to me are lying on the edge of the desk. Full of dust. Some of them fell to the ground. I never picked them up. 
The card my girlfriend made for our anniversary is buried under a pile of unopened mail, magazines, and empty forms.
My birthday presents I got two months ago are still in the gift bag. Full of dust as well.

 
I haven't been able to cook myself a good meal since half a year. I don't even know if I eat more than once a day. Once in a while I get so hungry I binge-eat anything I find. Mainly sweets and tasty, unhealthy stuff. I think about cancer. I always think about how I should eat vegetables and switch to a balanced nutrition. But then I remember that I can't go shopping. I can't. No, seriously, I can't.


I can't remember the last time I made the bed. Piles of clothes are lying on it, I throw them on the ground before I fall dead tired into the bed. 
I never do the laundry until I run out of clothes. It must have been years since the last time I've been shopping for new clothes. Shoes as well. I'll just wait until they will fall apart.
Pretty much the same with the dishes...Dirty dishes pile up until I run out of dishes. Then I put them into the dishwasher, but once it's finished I never put them back in the shelf, I just take them out one by one when I need them

My room is a mess. Dirty clothes are lying all over the floor, still packed backpacks are lying on the couch. 
My car needs maintenance, a lot of things have to be fixed. But I just drive it, waiting for the moment it will fall apart. 
Not just the car, my entire life. My entire life needs maintenance, but I'm just crawling from day to day, waiting for the moment it will fall apart.


Sometimes I look out of the window, seeing all the opportunities that are out there waiting for me. And then I get overwhelmed immediately, crawling back into my cave.

I don't shave until I get an unintended glance at the mirror and find myself full of disgust. I do brush my teeth, at least once a day, because I had enough caries as a child, being a lazy little fuck who didn't brush his teeth.
Fortunately I am able to take a shower almost everyday, since it's quite a nice feeling and a feeling of ""washing away"" that shitty mess of a life.

I'm in therapy, but psychotherapy doesn't do shit about my depression. Meds helped a bit. I've been on venlafaxine for a year, it was nice how I managed to keep going and do stuff. But I felt sad. Empty. Full of unsatisfied desires. I was also getting heavy heartburn from it. Got PPI for it, but I kept forgetting about taking it properly. 
Focussing has always been a huge problem for me, and the venlafaxine seemed to make it even harder. Suddenly, they were thinking about ADD, got some Ritalin, didn't do shit. Tried several other ADs, nothing changed. Thought I could go without meds, but it seems that I can't.

Why am I writing this? Venting and finding out if people experience the same shit as I do.

The way I heard it, when we were young children, she randomly burst into my room demanding NSFW activities. I refused; her reaction was to deliberately shit on me. Apparently, she had been previously, repeatedly raped by an adult she knew herself, and so at our age back then, she unfortunately developed the mindset that it was normal for all males of all ages to do that, and so likely got angry and confused when I rejected her, when she expected the same from me. Or so I was told about it years later, when I asked someone about my past.
Unfortunately, it was enough to trigger lifetime mental health issues, and it was exacerbated when I had abnormally early puberty due to my physiological issues stemming from my bio-mother's alcohol abuse prior to my birth. If I remember correctly, the puberty processes began at 8, and puberty was already in full swing by 10 or 11. Worse, I already had late development to begin with since workers originally thought I was below the threshold for mental disability before realizing I was actually quite high functioning, especially with waaaay above average IQ, before time and age (and shitty psych meds) reduced my brain process speed to just above the threshold for mental disability. It still didn't stop me from wanting a relationship throughout my life, and my exceptionally high libedo throughout may be a bit to blame, in a sense; such as appearing too desperate and such.
So I had chronic ""Oneitis"", lusting after girl after girl after girl, each rejecting me, (likely justified,) and eventually at 25 or so, I just gave up, after life events in combination with rejection, just utterly trashed my self-esteem. And in literally just the past year or two, I've acquired an enormous increase in my self-awareness, and a side effect of that is serious body shame issues, regarding my short stature, high Fran Drescher type voice, itself stemming from lifetime hearing loss due to said bio-mother's alcoholism, and weight gain. However, that last is one I'm actually proud of, since to me, it reflects my rebellious nature in the sense of my hatred of the ""hyper-healthy/hyper-fit lifestyle"" movement. So, perhaps paradoxically, it contributes to my self-worth issues in the sense that my observation is that pride in unhealthy lifestyles is highly unattractive.
But last fall, what little self-worth I had, already having been falling steadily throughout the year, plummeted when I turned 30.
Having been quite open about my sense of internal youth, feeling like a teen in mind and heart regardless of physical age, turning 30 hit me HARD. On the outside, I joke that to me, 30 is old. Most others say 30 is still young; but for me, my joke is that 30 is the equivalent of Larry King. 40 is the equivalent to the biblical age of Earth, 50 is the equivalent to the scientific age of Earth, and so forth.
And still being a virgin, I sympathised with a guy in a kinda similar situation who posted in a NSFW subred not to long ago. But when a comment to his post said this: >Stop treating your sex life as a summation of your value as a person. In fact, stop giving a fuck about it, period. That is all.
For me, I wanted to punch a hole in my wall. With brass knuckles. And also post a ""One does not simply..."" meme about giving up on sex stuff. Because the sheer inevitableness of this pissed me off to no end. I'm 30; research shows plummeting libido in men after 30. I hope I'm one of the few exceptions, but seeing that quote simultaneously pissed me off, depressed me, and made me feel hopeless and resigned to the inevitability of these otherwise well-meaning words. And what made me feel worse about it was that I actually felt some amount of willingness to actually do it, since I felt like other than that, there's not much I could do about it. Not to mention, to make things even more difficult, one of my biggest goals in life was to have a wife and a biiiig family, lotsa kids, etc. But knowing just even making friends after 30 is an uphill battle for the rest of your life, it makes me feel like one has even worse prospects for starting relationships beyond the platonic, after 30. It also conflicts with my high libedo, so while the regular occurrence of reduced sex drive after 30 may help my original life goals of having a family (or at least a life partner), it is still a huge bummer for me.
Also, my ADHD. It is rather frustrating catching myself having gone way off topic when writing a single long post. -_- Not sure how much of that occurred in this one. :/",depression,t5_2qqqf,I have no idea what broke me; endless rejection or a traumatic childhood experience I have no memory of.

This subreddit feels 'right' the most for me to write this thingy.  
I'm not sure if I have depression (I haven't been diagnosed); I've been feeling like shit for ~4 years on and off, more on than off for one year now. I had been harming myself frequently for last six months and stopped (so far 9 days without doing that which is my longest streak) and I almost constantly have thoughts about suicide.

I guess this is some kind of getting-it-off-my-chest-post.

Not having any real life friends feels shitty so here I am boring YOU with that crap. Apologies.

The funny thing is I have some other personality within me (as I see and feel it) which is always happy no matter what. I guess I developed that when my parents were going through a pretty long divorce (first they separated but my father stayed at the home and let's just say he was not being the nicest guy) and it kinda sticks around since that time. For example I see humour in absolutely everything, even my suicidal thoughts or sometimes I burst into euphoria for no reason whatsoever. It feels like it's me and a somewhat cynical, happy spectator watching from a third person perspective. I cannot describe it any better.

I am terrible at making friends and even if I succeed, that friend makes me feel undeserving of them so I have always at some point gave up on that friendship. I still am trying to find an actual friend, not going to quit trying that easily.

I've also noticed that I find it even harder to focus than before, that includes even things I do for fun.

I'm having hormonal depression from PMS along with exhaustion and stress of a family crisis this past month. 

I've gotten into a funk. The crisis was my alcoholic father had 2 seizures from a slight withdrawal, was hospitalized for 2 weeks. He's off alochol now and at home. My father has spoilt his children and made mum spoil him to the point where she never denies him anything. She does this to everyone to her detriment. Apart from rheumatoid arthritis and osteoporosis, she has serious cognitive issues and memory loss over the past few years and it just in the last year got worse. When dad was sick, she just shut down mentally. I had to be the one looking out and speaking with the doctors. Parents are in their 60's. 

My older brother (30) is depressed too from puberty. I don't hang out with him because he is mentally unstable and used to hit me just because he got angry. He has refused to get therapy. I finally got him to see my therapist. I think he went. I also believe he has hit others apart from me. Everyone in my house is depressed. 

I work for my father's partnership company because of the fibro and because if I didn't, my father would force mum to do the work. So I do it to save her. Now, my father moves so slowly and both parents can barely use the computer yet ask me to do everything. I work out of their home (i live alone because of fibro and it helped pain levels being out of the dysfunction), and am the house secretary and gofer. So I not only do work financial stuff, but personal stuff to including making appointments, checking dad takes his meds, taking him to doctor, paying bills. 

One friend said the simple solution would be for someone else to do my work. It would put me out of a job and I wouldn;t get any money otherwise nor be able to work a regular job. Where I live doesn;t have much flexibilty in work hours etc. (I'm in a small third world country. Secondly, my dad would neer let anyone handle the finances other than his family because he trusts only us. We woud all have to be dead, literally. 

I want to die. If I die, I'm afraid my family will go to shit. Mum would shut down completely. Dad would stress her to death and probably drink again. My brother wouldn;t help. Grandma would cry herself to death.

I try to do things I like usually but even those sadden me. I do latin dancing and video games but have bad self esteem. I see a great female dancer and get sad because no matter how long or hard I try, I can;t dance like that. I've taken classes, practised, had a partner, everything. I never get chosen to try a performance or considered for our small awards even though I express interest in learning to perform. 

With games, I prefer to play by myself because I am not good. I play with others since last year and most (guys) are impatient or kinda laugh at me. The guy I date sometimes is an asshole but he spoils me and his friends so I just use him for food and drinks. He;s been mean to me more than once so I don't feel bad about it. I have had 2 boyfriends and gone on dates but I don't meet anyone who is not an asshole, attractive or mature enough to settle down with. Here is small so I think I have exhausted my options. Plus I don't think anyone would want to be with me or I should pass on my genes. People generally suck, I've discovered as I've grown older. The really good people (people in general) are few and far between it seems. 

Sorry for the epistle. Thanks if you have read. Dunno why I'm even typing this shit. I wish I could just die and not be worried about my family. If I had a way to ensure that they would be ok, I would. Aside from that, I have no purpose and will have no time to try to date or start my own family now until another 20 years about. So what's the point? I'm sick of being depressed. Yes, I'm on medications too and see a therapist.

For the past few months, it seems like I've either seen things from the corner of my eye or heard things I knew weren't there or my senses will all of a sudden get way more intense.
- A few months ago I was driving on a road with wide lanes and not that many cars at all. I was speeding just a tiny bit but saw a cop car in the lane across from mine. I told my friend in the car with me, ""look at that cop!"" and slowed down a bit and my friend goes ""what cop?""
- A few weeks ago I opened a can of soda, drank some, and set it on the desk on the opposite side of the room then tried to go to bed. I couldn't sleep because I could hear the tiny fizz bubbles in the can fizzing and popping so loud. 
- I went up to my apartment yesterday and, since I was the first through the door, I held it open for my friend. My friend says thanks as I hear the hinges on the door as its closing, the door squeaks in a way that sounds exactly like ""no problem"" and internally I freak out for a few seconds cuz it sounded so real
- Just now I heard someone say my name, loud and clear, somewhere in my apartment but I know for a fact there's no one else here. It sounded a little bit like my friend, when they said my name it sounded whiny but in a confused way. For a split second I thought it was my roommate calling from outside the door wanting me to let her in cuz she forgot her keys or something. Then I remembered my roommate won't be back til tomorrow.

Little stuff like that has been happening, not super often but maybe once a week but it's gotten where I can notice it way more. Like, just now when I heard someone's voice I was about to get up and open the door, it was that clear.

EDIT: I have been diagnosed with PTSD. I've always attributed anxiety and negative feelings and memories to the PTSD but this stuff has only started recently.

I made this account specifically to try and do some reddit based therapy. I need to do SOMETHING, anything new that could help to keep me going. I've been through a lot of other therapy and I haven't tried anything in a while and I'm starting to feel so desperate. I can't seem to stick to seeing a counsellor or doctor, it's just painful. I used to blog which helped me a lot as I'm a creative type, but due to Narcissistic family my privacy was lost, a huge argument created and I lost my confidence in writing and deleted my blog.

I'm not really sure how to begin. I want to get better but I'm not sure I'll ever be 100% fully functional again. I know people with mental health issues are meant to take things day by day, but it's been a couple years now and I feel like I'm losing my youth and I'm just fed up of waiting for my life to properly begin. I feel like it's all or nothing with me; I either get to be myself 100% or I should just kill myself. I just want more than anything to be my authentic self without fear of repercussions or judgement but I'm constantly biting my tongue while I live at home with my family in a toxic and tense environment. I've gotten into the habit now of just trying to make others around me happy, at least for now. I think if January won't be my last month, February will. I told my mother she's probably going to lose me this year.

I want to be understood completely but there are just not enough words. I will try to explain why the last few months I'm feeling like finally giving up. I just want people to know I tried my hardest to get better and be a good person and friend, just in case I don't make it. It's really important to me that people know I tried. I hung in there for a really long time without help from anyone.

I'm going to talk ages and numbers and try to keep this medium length; I'll talk about the bad thing which caused my PTSD next post.
I think the last time I was truly happy was my 9th birthday and now I'm recently turned 23. 
I moved to a new place after my 9th birthday, didn't fit in. I got bullied so badly at my new school (it was a faith school too which didn't help in hindsight) I had to transfer at age 10 to a private school as it was the only one with any space. This caused a huge rift between my parents and brothers.
Private school was WAY different, I'd always been a state school kid before. I didn't get bullied, but I didn't make friends; I hid in the library at lunchtime and read stories to the younger kids. They were the only ones who didn't judge me, I treated them like my very own children despite being only a few years older. Not sure if that's really weird or not.
Hit 11 - secondary school. Bitch from private school spreads lots of rumours about me, plus all the people who bullied me in the faith school now go to this secondary school. (British school system sucks) Five years of mental and physical torture and hell begin, school is useless at helping. I develop unhealthy coping mechanisms (OCD not diagnosed til age 20 occurs now, as does self harm.) and this creates hellish tension with my Narcissistic mother. Repetitive behaviours and compulsions were insane back then. At age 12 after my very long hair is partially burnt off in science class by a bunsen burner by mean kids, I decide to kill myself.  I cut my body all over, but plan to slit my neck; I am seconds away from doing it when I hear my little brother singing and stop. I couldn't when he would be the one to find me. At 16 I date the first boy who ever paid me any attention (that was never going to end well was it?) and school ends. The friendship group I was in is weird and dark and I was the only girl.
 I start Sixth form college and love how intelligent everyone is at this new place.

Mother hates boyfriend and that friendship group instantly, although she never liked any of my friends, she becomes bullying and abusive more so than ever for about three years. Boyfriend cheats on me with best friend I made at college at 18, but I dump him before knowing this due to physical/mental (and with hindsight I guess sexual) abuse. Bullying and rumours spread so lose first ever close friends I ever made through no fault of my own. Mother says I told you so.

Drop out of college, restart second year at 19. Make new friends, most of them LGBT. Come out as bisexual for the first time since knowing I was bisexual since I was about 10; still close friends with these people to this day. Good people :-) Obviously to this day I'm 90% out, just not to my family as they can't be trusted.
However all the bullying, all the trauma and distress at home, at school, at college, bad attitude from a bitchy spanish teacher had set in and I get diagnosed with clinical depression. I stop coming in, I miss classes to cry in the bathroom for hours. People get called in. I have to drop out of college. I feel like a failure, I hardly leave my room, self harm is out of control, my older brother is at the TOP university and rubs my failure in my face. Uni meant the world to me. Suicide attempt #2, nobody finds out about it and I never tell. Another failure.

I try to go out more to cheer myself up. Some friends supportive, others not. Some days are good, a lot bad. I meet a boy at a party, he becomes my world. I think we are dating. He turns out to be a sociopath who has used me to further his connections to the fine art world and tells me we are not dating and it was all in my head. Gaslighting to the max. After finding no more use for me, he decides to become best friends with the girl (ex best friend) who my boyfriend mentioned above cheated on me with, for no other reason than ""just because"" despite not being friends with her before I told him what she did to me. I end all contact with him; very smart decision for me considering how much I used to let people walk all over me. I cry for months as it was the first time I had my heart broken. I consider suicide again.

However,  despite all of this I was so strong. I started getting better and eating right, working out, going out more with people and staying closer in touch with friends. I tried really really hard to get better and I even started getting on better with my family through sheer effort every day. Looking back on this time I am really proud of myself for the amount I achieved considering the pain I had been through.

....And then the bad thing (traumatic event) happened and now my life is unbearable. It's not fair is it?
I hope people see how much I've been through, then understand why it's so difficult for me to try and get over this now. 
It's not that I'm not trying, and it's not that I'm weak or lazy like my family thinks.

Anyway, a month or so afterwards I met a girl at the local drinking hole, and we hooked up immediately. She saw the squalor I was living in and cleaned the entire apartment and is acting really sweet and caring towards me - no comparison to the psychotic ex-wife. This lady is actually nice, or so I suspect. However, she is very hurt internally - she has 3 kids, also suffers from depression, and has a bit of a drinking problem. We are just sex buddies for now - not emotionally involved with her in any way.

The current big problem is the following: Last night we went to a party that the Polish consul to Mexico attended, and I had to meet him to give him some documents so I can get the Polish passport. My lady friend came with me and drank herself silly - the Costa Rican Polish community (there's no Polish embassy here, so the embassy in Mexico covers Central America). The party was full of Polish people, who were drinking in moderation, but my lady friend got so hammered that she was falling over and speaking loudly, and some people in the party interfered and said that she could not drink anything anymore. I was a bit tipsy but kept my composure. I'm panicking about having given everybody there a bad impression, and for the consul to not take me seriously at all. This passport process is dragging and I do not know what will happen now after this ""incident"". I hope I can still get the passport, as it's key for me to move to Europe once and for all, and hope that the consul will still be able to help out after this problem.

So I have been self harming for few years now. I usually burn myself but I also bang my wrists against the wall (i dont really know if that counts as self harm, and I usually dont refer it as self harm but figured I should mention it). 

I havent really made an active effort to stop it. When I started college I drank alcohol instead of burning myself but since I dont have a ton of money I cant always get alcohol so I burn myself instead. 

I dont really have a problem with it though. The burning I do doesnt really endanger me in any way, I just heat up a pin and press it against my skin. It hurts and it leaves a scar but nothing more. I burned myself with a cigarette as well, but that was a one time thing. 

So it's not dangerous or life threatening or anything. I dont mind doing it, and it helps me calm down when my depression is overwhelming me (it also helps kill any, really bad thoughts). The only bother is I have a few scars on my arm from it and sometimes people ask and I kind of have trouble coming up with an excuse. 

Im an adult so I dont feel like its an issue much because I am in control of what I do. When I was younger I really tried to stop because the pain in my friend's eyes when she saw I had done it again killed me. but once i went to college i felt fine doing it. and i have a friend who knows i actively burn myself. and she doesnt seem to really care that I do. I tell her sometimes if I do it, or I mention it, and she doesnt seem to be concerned so I dont feel bad doing it. 

but i know I shouldnt. its probably not a good coping mechanism or anything. and i hate trying to come up with stories to cover for it over and over again. 

so i guess im asking. How should i feel? is it okay that i self harm? should i be trying to stop?

So quick bg. Ive been dealing with depression for about 7 years now. Im 22. At 18 I checked myself into a hospital for being suicidal. This was at the suggestion of a person I was talking to at the time, and because I was going to kill myself the night before and one of my best friends begged me not to. She lives on the other side of the coast. I couldnt see her but all that crying over the phone kept me alive long enough to check myself in. I have self harmed in the past and continue to do so now (though much much much less frequently).

Okay, so thats a quick history of that. So I have not been so suicidal since that time in my life, but my depression has definitely continued on and has kinda been going through points where it is really bad to being not so bad but still there. Its been hitting me pretty hard recently, and i decided to see a school therapist. hes nice and great but i am really bad at talking to strangers so i havent really expressed myself fully to him at all. I plan to, but i am not at that level yet. 

People who i have an easy time talking to though, are my friends. Specifically i have one friend who ive kind of expressed most my feels to and shes really supportive. But I try not to talk to her about it too much because she has a lot a lot of shit to deal with in her life so unless im feeling absolutely terrible I dont ask for her support or anything. 

And by absolutely terrible im not sure what i mean. so i guess a better way is, if i deem the time between when i talked to her last as long enough, then ill talk to her. 

but in the meantime im just completely falling apart. im scared of myself and i just have all this feelings of sadness or just like really negative feelings. i cant even really describe it but its painful to the point where i get a physical pain in my chest. my whole mind just doesnt feel right and like i dont even know what to do and i dont even express it 99% of the time because i try to act so strong through it all and i wake up every morning and keep going and tell jokes and smile so everyone thinks im okay. and i smile and laugh and act happy most importantly so my friend thinks im okay and so that i can be strong for her and do anything to support her because like i said earlier shes got a lot of shit. but its so so so hard. im just like dying inside and feel so hopeless and stuck. i think thats the worst part. i feel freakin trapped. like what do i do. when does it end? it doesnt

i hate all these people in the world saying it gets better. or itll be okay. or youre okay. i dont blame them. i say the same bullshit to people to because i dont know what else to say. words are bullshit. it doesnt make me feel better. i feel the same. and i just want to get better. but this could be the rest of my life. i just have to 'deal'. what the fuck is the point of a life like that? im not suicidal, but sometimes i wish i could just die just because thats honestly the only solution to getting better. im not suicidal. i just say that because im frustrated. sorry.

anyways, so im just falling apart, i dont feel comfortable telling my therapist. telling my friend and being with my friend makes me feel okay but she cant be there for me the rest of my life. im an adult. i have to take care of myself and she has shit to deal with anyways. so like. what do i do i guess im asking? or like what. there is no answer. how do i deal with that?",depression,t5_2qqqf,how do i deal with myself?

With all of the shit I've gone through and the shit I am dealing with in college, with every reminder I have to fight a compelling force within me to shatter my phone to a thousand pieces.

One of them was a gang rape at 13 with four guys and even with that being pretty clearly rape, I still have guilt and shame over not being able to prevent it or thinking I could have done things differently, or dressed differently (not even sure what I was wearing) or not been there etc. I have been having flashbacks constantly about these various things that have happened my whole life, but recently been remembering something else that I never really thought of as rape, till maybe now?  

I had a boyfriend when I was around 17/18 and it was an awful relationship. He watched a couple times as I was brutally beaten by a group of guys outside of where I was working at the time. He only stood there to protect himself and the whole time I had an eye on him, until my eyes were swollen shut and I could barely see him. Well, after that and I was so physically hurt (emotionally dead) he tried to have sex with me. I wouldn't that time because I was in so much pain, but he wouldn't take no for an answer and forced himself on me harder than he ever has. I felt like my body was breaking and wished to die. He had done that a few times in the relationship on the rare occurrence that I would say no.  Is that considered rape?  Is that all my fault for staying? At the time, I was stripping and giving most of my money to him, so I guess I deserved it. I obviously deserved no respect. I guess I want to hear from someone else.  I hope I gave enough detail.

I'm also aware that I can be manipulative. I can look at a situation or a person and see exactly how to play things to get what I want. However, I don't do that. People I don't care about, sure, I have no massive issue with some mild manipulation to get that kiss or whatever etc. but with people I do care about, I am constantly thinking over everything I do to make sure it is honest and not me twisting anything.

But at the moment I keep being accused of twisting things. I know I'm prone to see everybody else as wrong, but I honestly feel that I am right in these situations. For instance; my friend has been telling me consistently how much he hates children, especially the children he's teaching. He says he hates teaching in general, he once told his class he didn't like them and then stormed out, and told me that he hadn't been marking his class' work because was ""bored"". This is all exactly what he told me. Verbatim. I tried to avoid the subject but he kept talking about it, so I told him it was incredibly irresponsible and unfair on the children, the way he was treating the children, and that it's childish to think you can just stop doing a job when you get bored. He called me emotionally abusive, a liar and a bully for saying so. He's also called me this after telling me only bad things about his flatmate and me forming a negative opinion of him, and various other incidents. 

He claims that I phrase everything deliberately to make him feel shit - why I'd want to do that, he refuses to say. I've pointed out that thanks to my severe anxiety and how much I care about him, I think over everything I say to him to make sure I'm not accidentally offensive. I have panic attacks now, worrying that I've accidentally offended people because my efforts don't seem to be working.

I just can't tell whether I'm right or wrong. I don't see that I'm being offensive at all, but more that he is a psychologists dream and is projecting all of his own problems onto me because I'm the more clearly unstable of the two of us (he won't admit it but he's having another depressive episode).

I feel like I'm eternally stuck being a ""teenager"". 

I live with a narcissistic mother and a father who never taught me about how truly scary and intimidating the real world is. I came from an abusive and controlling household and the verbal/emotional abuse from my parents left me a low self esteem. 

In essence, I am a lost and helpless child inside the body of a 20 year old woman. 

I have Clinical Depression, GAD, manic episodes, and just... a myriad of mental instabilities flowing around my mind.

I can't move out and get a job and function normally like an adult due to crippling social anxiety/ depression. I desperately tried to find a job for over six months now but my social anxiety/ depression/ lack of social skills made employers just... disregard and ignore me as a potential employee. And I know it's my fault. :( 

I'm trying to ""grow up"", but I have no positive role models in my life. My parents just want me to graduate from college, get a job but- I have no knowledge or skills on how to do such a thing. They pressure and expect success from me but I... have no idea how to do so. 

My lack of knowledge contributes to my depression. I feel like a lazy, worthless, stupid little girl who can't grasp the real world. My ex boyfriend even calls me a little girl and the verbal abuse he gave me crippled what little self esteem I had, or anybody in my life who insulted me and belittled my worth. My mind instantly fixates on the insults, the abuse, the hateful toxicity that poisons my mind. I genuinely believe I am a bad person and I despise myself for it. 

The thing is, should  I even go to therapy? I'm scared I'll be wasting my money for nothing. 

My financial situation is this- I'm a poor college student, currently attending a community college. ( Because I literally have no life goals and I'm literally drifting around lost in a huge sea. ) 

Despite my parents being emotionally/verbally abusive, I live with them rent-free and I know financial situation wise it is best to continue living with them despite the rough patches of emotional/verbal abuse that I get from them. I know that if I move out with said money, it's a high-risk gamble because what if I can't find a job while I moved out and stay at a low-rent apartment? It's game over and I'll go back home with no money and parents telling me "" I told you so. "" 

I have $2100 dollars in my savings accumulated from my financial aid money. I haven't touched said money and ask for advice regarding on what would be best for my situation finance wise/ or what to do in general. 

Go to therapy first, and then hear what the therapist says? I have insurance under my Father's insurance plan. ( Blue Shield of CA - HMO plan ) I'm not that smart regarding health insurance, but I know my Father's plan has me covered until I am 26 under Obama Care? I just know if I go to therapy I'll have to pay co-payments but I'm paranoid of spending my savings. I really am undecided on what to do. :( 

I'm not exactly sure what subforum to post on by the way. I know I'm just confused and lost and scared on what to ask but my general problem is that I have until February 9th ( School starts ) to know what my battle plan is. I would love to hear insight/ advice from fellow redditors who might be able to give a penny or two of wisdom... If you managed to read this, thank you very much. To be honest, I have a psychological problem where I can't really trust my own decisions and rely on others to give me a better insight on things because I concur that my mental illness equates to stupidity in my own mind. I don't make the most smartest of choices... 

I'm sorry, I know I sound really stupid...

I'm not suicidal really, but I'm feeling very replaceable at work, in my relationship, and my family is great but I'm a tremendous burden on them. 

At the beginning of last year, I was drugged and robbed on a thursday night, an event that cost me thousands replacing what was stolen, but also cause me to miss work on a day that was very important that I be there. No one at work believes that I was drugged, and maybe they shouldn't I don't know. But I do know that I am loosing reasons to be glad I made it out of that situation alive. Maybe its just the shitty weather today but god. I have this sinking feeling of worthlessness in my chest. It could be just a matter of my perspective, and often it is.

I was born in Germany, am German. Or was. I've lived in the U.S. since I was 8. My mom and dad divorced when I was 2, and my mom took me and moved here once she met someone out of the Air Force. Left my entire family overseas, and contact has waned over time. It's very lonely and I want to cry nearly every time my friends have family occasions. I've seen my dad 4 times in 16 years, my family twice.

Anyways, said AF guy was a giant prick. We'll call him Ron, because that was his name and f*** him. He hit me a lot and was incredibly emotionally abusive to both of us. (This was when I started experiencing what I know now is anxiety.) We ran away after 4 long years. I'm over it, whatever.

High school started not too long after. That is when /it/ first reared it's head. Around 13, depression started to sink in. Noticeably. I remember my friends commenting that I should just be my goofy, cheerful self. That I should stop trying to be cool, or fit in, or whatever. Trust me, I was far from cool in high school and I certainly wasn't trying.

I did get along great with my friend Sadie though. She was my friend since the 2nd grade when I moved here. She moved to another state for a couple years, but came back during high school after one of her friends died in a car wreck. We were still best friends, except for now we were both depressed. 

We found that we enjoyed smoking. Drinking. We tried hard to forget, for years until our 20s. She started taking morphine and somas. She stopped showing up to parties, and I was too busy partying to care. Then she left this world.. I abandoned my best friend. I can't write anymore about this so moving on.

I started doing things she had, ironically. It made me hate myself even more. But I never died, although I came close. I wanted to. School suffered, clearly. I was going for music, so not exactly hurting my future wages but whatever.

Met a girl. Fell in love. Both our issues imploded that relationship after 2 years. I took it badly, no surprise, but I've stabilized to my previous ""just depressed"" state. I'll stay away from girls for a while.

After, I needed to do what I wanted to do with my life, which is make music. So I signed up for a 2 year AA program in music production. Not Fullsail expensive, but a nice 30k loan. Not the wisest decision, but it could have been worse. I don't regret it, if anything I can get some office or call center job. Please shoot me.

Enter this little quarter life crisis I've been having. Depression has gone nearly out of control. My dad has paid me an allowance all my life, someone give that man a medal, but he retired this year so no more. I haven't worked a day since 2009, I've just been trying to pull myself together all my life. Now I'm melting down. I hadn't even considered it until it hit me: 20 bucks in my account and rent is coming up. No job. I'm roommates with my friend and I'm about to let him down big time.

I can't even make music, my solace, because my computer is dead (which is the reason for this possibly awful formatting, I'm about to send it through alien blue).

I just feel like I keep on hoping. Hoping for some intransient happiness. I try not to hate myself, I really do. I've seen doctors, tried many meds. Only weed keeps me level, but I don't have room in the budget any more so I'm just winging it.

My goal is to move to LA and at least be able to make a living through songwriting and making music. I feel like I would be happy. (I'm terribly shy, I don't want to be on stage. What a cruel joke for a musician! Haha.) I just feel like I've run out of gas, and I don't know what to do any more.

..Thank you if you made it this far, and for any words you have to offer. This has been cathartic for me. If you are here you are probably depressed too. I think we'll be okay.. But how?

Over the previous semester, I had a terrible terrible crush on a girl classmate. After nearly a month of chickening out, I did it and approached her (very awkwardly). We became decent friends and everything and because of her, I realized and faced my social anxiety. I started taking walks, going to coffee shops, trying to start conversations with strangers, and doing anything that would make me uncomfortable just to face my anxiety.   But I paid a price: I fell into depression. For one reason or another, I became terribly depressed. I don't have much friends to start with, and out of the handful I have more than half of them I don't regularly talk to. But I felt lonelier than ever. I can't pinpoint a reason for the depression, but I know it somehow had to do with my anxiety and me putting myself outside of my comfort zone. The more i try to pinpoint a reason, the more lost i get. My depression got so bad I would stand under the shower and let freezing cold water blast over my body in an attempt to ""wake myself up."" Every morning on the way to college while standing on the platform waiting for the train a brief thought of jumping on the track would cross my mind. I would go out in freezing weather wearing weather-inappropriate clothes and the pain would still be nothing compared to the mental pain I had. I even pinched myself a couple of times and didn't feel a thing. I remember one day it got so bad the minute I walk into my apartment I ran to the bed and buried my face in the pillow and screamed at the top of my lungs and teared up a bit and fell asleep for a really long time. I had a few hours in the middle of it all where I would feel really ecstatic for no apparent reason, but the second the sun sets and I'm alone at home I fall into depression once more for no apparent reason. I was already lonely to start with due to my anxiety, but I felt lonelier than ever during my depression. 

Long story short, it eventually got better and faded away. Ever since then, I would get an occasional kick in the gut from the remnants of it but it fades away just as fast as it came. But today, I'm getting the all-too-familiar feeling of loneliness and sadness, and I really don't know why I'm getting it. I simply woke up this morning feeling down for no reason I can think of. I got out of bed and went to skate for a bit thinking I can cheer myself up and that it's nothing, but it's 2:40 AM now and I'm still feeling lonely and empty and unmotivated. But again I thought it was nothing, but not too long ago, I found myself thinking about suicide again. After a few minutes, I realized what I was thinking about and I got scared shitless. My dad is coming over to visit me tomorrow and will be staying over for a few days. He has no idea about my anxiety or depression or anything I go through because I keep it all to myself. Maybe that's somehow the reason it's coming back? This demon is terrifying and I never want to go through it again. I really don't. Holy fucking shit I would do anything to not go through it again. It was the worst experience of my life. I'm really scared.

I know in therapy if you express plans to hurt yourself or others you get reported. But what does this mean? I am not going to harm anyone, but I have struggled with self harm and idealizing (?) suicide. I dont have a plan to commit suicide or anything, and I know I am not going to commit suicide, but ive been in that kind of ""id rather be dead"" mood. And wanting to die but not going to (mainly because i have a shit ton of loans). I want to talk to my therapist about this but I dont want to be hospitalized or anything. So I was wondering if you guys knew what it meant to be reported and what kind of things do you express to be reported. 

A few years back I committed myself to a hospital for suicidal thoughts that I was going to act on.  Not sure if that will make a difference.

Also, I was wondering how often we can post on here? I made a post not too long ago and am not sure if there was a post limit?

Make small-talk unwillingly. Run out of things to talk about. Awkwardly stare off into space to avoid interacting with coworkers. Make it through the day without any bad things happening.

Due to some past experiences and a general lack of confidence I always feel like I am not good enough for anybody and that my SO will leave me as a result. Unfortunately I become needy and clingy in an effort to ensure that I won't be abandoned, I constantly need to be with or talk to the person and require regular validation of our relationship. I often talk about how much I am ""in to"" that person when we are together, to the point that it becomes annoying to them. I will send text messages in the mornings and obsess over how fast I'd get replies, beforehand I get very depressed and when I finally get a reply I am ecstatic. 

The problem is that this becomes a self fulfilling prophesy for me. I was recently talking to this girl who I was really into, like a lot. We had seen each other a lot recently and had had sex and everything, so I kind of assumed we were dating.  I thought things were going great, but she suddenly lost interest in me. When I asked what happened, she said that I smothered her and got too clingy and assumed we were dating when we, in fact, weren't. 

I was crushed, devastated really. It had only been a few weeks, but I had grown really attached to this person, too much so in retrospect. But I am so lonely otherwise, I really desire a relationship so I was thrilled to have found someone. I wanted it to work so badly that I destroyed it, my fear of abandonment lead to my abandonment, again. 

Anyone have any tips on how to not be so clingy? How to be more comfortable with myself and my relationships. I don't want to drive the next person I care about away. ",BipolarReddit,t5_2qzru,"I fear abandonment and it makes me clingy, then it destroys my relationships."

I just recently got on insurance (never had it before in my life, just tried to solve it myself or go to the state clinic) and I didn't know I should be researching my doctors.

I previously was seeing a psychiatrist with my county's mental health services.  He was my medication management for treatment against depression and anxiety.  I've been seeing him for the last five years, and I have since formed a physical dependence on benzodiazepines.

Well, I got on insurance because my wife and I are in our 30s and we are finally a little financially stable so it was the right time to have kids.  I don't think its right to deny my parents the pleasure of having kids, and I wasn't sure I wanted children.  I'm pretty happy at being a dad, though, my daughter was born a few days ago.

Anyways, I've switched over my new psychiatrist for two months now.  I didn't actually see the doctor, just the nurse for the first month.  She prescribed me meds, but was very concerned about my enjoyment of trees.  At that time, I learned that the Dr. was an addiction specialist.  Okay, so what, I thought at the time, as I am not addicted to anything, and he was ten minutes from work, perfectly located for avoiding traffic.  

The last two appointments, I waited about 50 min, and an hour.  Okay, so he's busy, I thought.  I don't wanna be a dick.  

Well, about three weeks ago now I decided that I needed to be at my most stable, especially when my wife was 36 of 40 weeks pregnant.  Like before, when I was younger, I reacted poorly to fetzima.  I had vomiting, nervousness, racing thoughts: I felt really crazy.  At first I thought I had food poisoning or something, and I ended up taking all of my meds in half the time I was supposed to.  You can seize up or go into psychosis if you go through withdrawal, so I was really concerned.  I stopped the antidepressant a couple of days later after  feeling crazy and missing work and realizing that I was having a bad reaction.

So I try to reach my psychiatrist, and there's nothing.  No answering machine, no person to speak to, and this was during what was supposed to be office hours on Friday at 4:30.  I tried looking for his info online, couldn't find any way to get ahold of him.  I was flipping out and called my therapist, who told me to go into emergency.  I really don't want to go, and I'm glad I didn't because my wife went into labor five days after I started feeling wrong and have side effects.

Long story short I finally reach the office who gets me to a nurse who tells me a few days later I should continue my meds (its been 5 days, and my WIFE IS GOING INTO LABOR, I AM NOT GOING TO KEEP RISKING FEELING CRAZY WTF WTF WTF).  The nurse said the doc to just hang on, and made me an appt for 4 days later, on today, Thursday.

Well, at that pt I had decided I had enough.  I was telling myself that as my therapists say, I shouldn't just endure, I need to self advocate.  No one will save me if I don't save myself.  No one will come to my aid if I cannot stand.  I have to be able to defend myself.

So I build myself up, and I write up a letter because I'm not a great talker and I prefer to write.  And I go to his office.  And I wait.  Again.  And after an hour, I decide I have enough.  So I write on his letter I'm leaving, and I'm not taking this crap anymore, and I demand a resolution.  As I'm walking out the psychiatrist greets me in the hall and I ignore his face and I hand the letter to the receptionist, telling her to please give it to the doctor.

My heart is pounding, my hands are sweating, I'm shaking, and I force myself to walk to my car.  And I drive home in the cold, wondering if I made the right choice.  At the same time, I yell at myself for being a coward, and not standing up for what I believe in.  

Fuck.  I feel like I""m going crazy.  But I'm trying to use my DBT skills and the beautiful new baby and how happy everyone is to just. Keep. It. Together.

I'm trying to and hope I get my old doc back and hope I don't go into w/d because my wife cannot take care of everything herself and I NEED to be here to help.  Man, am I losing my grip?  No one knows me here, why am I asking?

I dunno..I need to end this somewhere.

The guy already knows about my depression and the issues that caused it, but the other 2 only know the issues and not that it's still causing me pain. I want to tell the 2 girls that I'm extremely depressed and that I would love it if they could help me, but I don't want to put a lot of pressure on them to help me. I recently just contacted them 2 weeks ago talking about how my ex broke up with me, but they don't know anything more than that. I'd like their help to get me through this because I abandoned them for 3 years while I was in my relationship. 

I was looking through my steam library and saw all the coop games we used to play and started crying because I miss her so much. She's not coming back, but I miss all the things we did together. Writing this is hard because the more I type the more I think about her and the stuff we did together. It feels like one big nightmare that is reoccurring and won't stop. Everyday is harder or easier than the day before, one day I'll wake up fine, play some games, go to school, come home, sleep, and repeat. I need to break the cycle of doing the same routine. It's hard to get up from bed knowing that she's gone, If it were up to me I'd take sleeping pills every single moment I wake up just so I can be at peace and sleep and not have to worry about doing things. It sounds cliché but it's like my days don't end when she's gone, it just feels the weeks we've been broken up just feel like a long day. I try to go out whenever I can, and while driving if a song pop ups that remotely reminds me of her I have to change it before I start tearing up.

I've been having a bad memory for the past few years, and sometimes it's a blessing and a curse. It's a blessing that my horrible memory is helping me forget that I had a wonderful girlfriend, but it's a curse when it comes to simple things - like remembering school work, notes etc. 

I'll never find anyone like her, someone who likes games just as much as me, enjoys playing them, and likes playing them with me. I miss her, I really do. 

I wish she didn't leave. I can't help but think there was something I could've done to make her stay, be nicer, be more caring, be more interactive, looked better, etc. (Not that I wasn't caring and nice, I was - but maybe I could've been an even better boyfriend.)

I'm still not feeling any better. I just got back from an interview yesterday for a sales job and they already sent the rejection email. They basically said that I lacked confidence in myself and felt I wouldn't be a good fit for the role.

It's so frustrating because I can't get experience/confidence in a responsible role like this unless I get a job like this. It's a Catch-22. I just hate how backwards the logic of this world is and how no one wants to lend a hand to help. Though, I'll admit that I should have did internships in college. I just need a decent job so I can afford a healthy lifestyle.

I just really want to be a confident person. I've wanted it since I was a teenager. I want to look in the mirror and like myself. I want to be a lady killer and date around, but even though I've been told I'm good looking, I don't currently have the right personality and I don't even know how I ever will. And living at home only makes it worse and I have no idea how I can with what I currently make.

I ultimately want to get into a programming role (maybe making video games), or to start my own online business so I can travel anywhere I want, but even that seems out of my grasp. I lack the experience as well and have no projects. I have no energy to make any projects because I'm so depressed with my life all the time. I can't even get the motivation to go jogging or do bodyweight exercises (can't afford to go to the gym). I just hate how I'm either at work or in front of my computer at home. And I can't afford to see a therapist or get medication because I have no health insurance (thought I wouldn't be at Walmart at this point, so I didn't sign up for health insurance with them). I barely even eat either, and when I do, it's almost always unhealthy crap (fast food, candy, etc.). I'm not fat by any means (I'm actually really skinny), but I can feel the effects of my lifestyle, and it's not good.

I know that I'm a loser, but have no idea how to fix it. And all people want to do is make fun of people like me instead of offering solutions. I just hate being this person and feel like there's no way out, and ending it all would be for the best.

In the meantime, I'm working at Walmart and living at home. I'm beginning to think I should just see if I can move up to a management position so I can start making real money (but I really hate this company and what it stands for), or maybe take up that English teaching position offered to me in Japan (it will be expensive to move, though, and there's not much career growth).

October 27, I moved into my still current apartment with a coworker I thought I could trust, I was a bit impatient at the time because things were starting to happen too fast for me. I'm 27 M and she was 45+ F; I'm Filipino-American born in the US and the whitest among my family, she was full Filipino raised in the Philippines. We aren't related and she definitely isn't my type. I had a bad feeling when we moved into the apartment but dismissed it because it was the first time I lived without family, was recently living with my cousin just before her husband and his daughter moved in.

I had a job working $10/hr but only working 4 hours a day 4 days a week. not a lot to make rent and pay my bill. I live on a small island for a year shops are close together but almost all of them had the high school kids as employees, hard to find a position when looking for a job, but I did get one at a fastfood place. Work was going good I was able to pay my half of ALL the rent, utilities, and other bills even those that aren't in my name but still used(cable/internet). After paying the Deposit and the Pro-rated rent pay for Oct I had to pay the rent for Nov at the start of the month. Not a problem, still had some money left over but just enough so I wouldn't be under. After a while, I notice that my hours for the job we share are starting to get shorter, not that my work hours were being cheated but just losing an hour a day. Then it started to be that I wouldn't work an entire day, then it was 2 work days a week at 4 hours a day. Talking with my boss, many of our customers were gone for the holidays or were snowbird heading to warmer weather, so that was okay. but my roommate would still go to work on regular days on regular hours. Still have my second job.

In November, my roommate tells everyone that she is going to the Philippines to get married and will be gone for a month and 1 week. So I make preparations to pay some bills early, but she says she took care of some of them, asked me for some money and sent off the envelopes. Tries to have a talk about rent but that was never able to happen, I've been busy with my second job and just could meet when we were off work. November 23 comes around and she leaves for the airport, Too many things are just out of wack by now. The work phone and work calender aren't handed in to my boss, She doesn't leave any contact info to reach her in the Philippines, and she doesn't leave to anyone her flight itinerary stating what day she will return.

My roommate also didn't tell the property manager of her trip nor did she pay for the next months rent (December). As usual I pay my half directly to them get my receipt and then asked if she paid before she left, they didn't know she was gone and she didn't make her payment. so I pay it off completely in a few days, had to borrow some money but i paid it. I also found out she didn't pay off a few of the bills, electric was late and the internet bill was never received. Paid the Electric bill since it wasn't as high as last month but the internet bill I didn't pay. Usually it's supposed to be 39.99 a month exactly, which I would have paid, but this time it was 90 some dollars. It wasn't in my name so I tossed it, not breaking my bank for a bill not in my name.

A lot of things happened in december and I was forced to leave my second job, nervous breakdown, anxiety attack, near suicide attempt, blah blah blah, said this before, feel abandoned by friends. deep heavy depression sets in. for the sake of moving on with things, I'm okay but still dealing with things.

January starts and I talk to the property management about my roommate and the situation she is putting me in financially. They say I can't get out until she returns and signs papers saying she can pay for rent on her own. Me being naive and concerned for my own ability to rent in the future proceed to pay my half of rent again, it wasn't until a few days later that I found out my roommate sent them an email stating she was going to pay the full rent of January on the 20th. The 20th comes and goes and no rent. On the 21st I received a letter on my front door saying 'pay rent or vacate in 3 days' and still no sign of her.

Like I said before her trip was supposed to be a month and a week, returning Jan 10th. then she changes it to the 16th, then the 20th. No I just heard from my boss that she doesn't plan on coming back until another week from now. I haven't gotten this news to the Prop. manager yet. Right now I'm starting to pack up my stuff In preparations for me moving out because I'm tired of this shit. I can't get my rent back and I can forget about the deposit.

Definitely NOT paying the rest of the rent nor the additional late fees and posting charges. Prop. Management hasn't been helpful in any of this.

Personally I hope her plane crashes or she gets stalled so long that her possessions are disposed of by the cleaners, which is practically the entire apartment. Although I've been told not to, I really want to take all of her stuff and just bleach everything, property damage and police aren't worth it.

Right now I just don't feel anything. not angry, not anxious, not stressed, not paranoid, not happy, not sad, can't even say 'I feel like bleh.' Just getting ready to move out but not sure what to do. I want to move in with friends, the ability to split bills multiple ways will help me save some money, but they're having their own issues and being grumpy and moody and avoid talking. I might stay long enough to be served eviction letter, and to make things extremely uncomfortable for my roommate when she finally arrives, with her husband this time.

Can't say I've come to peace with my situation, I've been taken advantage of for my credit score and my finances. Dealing with depression, loneliness, and just absolute rage at times. I really hate this, I try to take control of my life but still forced to rely on unmoving people who don't give a shit or just can't understand what I'm going through. Sometimes I don't even know.

Well I'm stopping now. I feel my mood starting to change and don't want to rant about everything.

She thought that was the reason they got a divorce, her mother cheated on her father. Because of the divorce, she suffered through depression and that she would never forgive her mother for what she did.

The people where she lived were snobby too, they were rich brats who wanted nothing but sex, cheating, lying, drugs, and money. She said she was different, that she hated the people like that. In the end she she became the thing she hated.

We went through 3 years, and she caused the breakup. She's causing all my pain, suffering, depression, suicidal thoughts and if she were to ever come back - I don't know if I would take her back. I'd be at a crossroad. I've been told that cheaters will cheat again, but I also want the girl I fell in love with back if she's not fully gone already.

And I'm always doing shit like this.

I don't know if I'm depressed, but I'm fairly certain I have low self esteem. However, every time I try to seek some advice concerning the rectification of this low self-esteem, I have realized that I am unconsciously doing so to make people say nice things about me, because hearing nice things makes me feel good (duh). In a word, I'm doing it for attention.

On top of that, a lot of the issues that I'd thought had arisen from some internal conflict were actually just me wanting to feel special. Which is still an internal conflict, but the kind of conflict self-centered assholes have.

So... what does that mean for me? I dislike who I am as a person, but that hasn't kept me from being judgemental, impulsive, selfish, whiny, and generally the kind of person who would normally be responsible for causing mental health issues in other people.

You know, writing gives me a release. 

To be honest, I really don't want to go out on a date with Jad today. Last night he implied wanting one of those ""muscle drinks"", and to be honest, I really don't want to buy him one. I offered I did, out of kindness, but deep down I felt horrible because I was planning on saving up the money for the therapist. I feel horrible spending money on him and I don't know why. He was gracious, but why do I feel like he was manipulating me? Why?

This entire day I spent it being on my bed browsing through Reddit and having an internet addiction. I have said internet addiction for a couple of years. It distracts me from this boring reality and it gives me a temporary escape from how begrudgingly normal this society is. 

Perhaps I'm a pessimist, and so much more. But I kept thinking about the mistakes I have done in my past. I feel horrible to this day. 

Why do I hurt people? Why do I lie compulsively? Why am I such a horrible liar? Why do I give fake promises to people? 

It hurts, it hurts. I have been in so much denial that I do harm to others. 

It hurts that I feel like I am a major misfit to this society. Why? Why can't I be normal? 

I know I'm normal but I have hobbies and activities that are considered ""abnormal"" to the typical person. I'm so ashamed of having these people know them because they are hobbies meant for teenagers. I don't want to grow up though. I don't. 

I know I'm a bad person and I want to change. I know I have empathy deep down but I feel so horrible when I can't help people. It makes me feel worthless, like I shouldn't try to help people anymore. I feel trapped and lonely and worthless. 

I don't want to go on a date with him because I know how it'll turn out. It's really really HARD to force myself to be happy because of this depression of mine. My mind is so negative and it hurts and I'm just alone here in my room being reminded of what a piece of worthless shit I am. I deserve to punish myself for my mistakes. I don't recall the last time I did something inherently good for a person. I've done so many regrettable things in my life and now at the age of 20 I opened my eyes and I just. I feel like a monster. 

I'm not proud of myself. I'm not proud of who I became. I hate myself. I hate myself. 

I'm going to spend the entire day being trapped in this room alone being in front of this computer screen using the internet and my cellphone as an escape from reality. I can't fit in with society. I just can't. 

Should I even bother going on a date with my boyfriend? Its 4 PM. It's probably too late. But if I do go, I'm going to have to spend money on him regardless. I promised him I would want to buy him a drink. But why do I feel so horrible? I've been so used to this. I've been used to spending lots of money on him. Why am I crying over money issues? This is so stupid.

I haven't yet written about my traumatic episode which I only refer to as ""the bad thing"" and to be honest I'm not sure I can cope with writing it out yet.

2014 was a great year for my recovery. I overcame my 2/3 year bout of agoraphobia and started going out more and even got a small no-big-deal part time job doing something I like with people who are kind. But since November I've been on a slow downward spiral, and I'm not even sure why!

Anyone who has survived a suicide attempt and then been discharged from hospital will know that horrible feeling in your gut when you go home. It's like coming back from a long holiday and walking into your house with all the lights turned off, curtains closed and it's cold from nobody being around to turn the central heating on. So deflating.

I've had that same feeling  creeping up on me since November, but it's been really strong for the past 2 weeks. It's really difficult to cope, I'm constantly on edge and it's exhausting. I don't know why it's suddenly got so much worse, I was doing so well! :(
I've been having to keep myself distracted every second of the day otherwise I just crack and start crying and I'm scared what that will lead to. Maybe self harm or worse? I already have enough old scars, I don't need to start doing that again.

Right now I'm slowly eating almonds just to distract myself; I'm not even hungry, but chewing on something feels good. It's sort of like when you get stressed and need to grind your teeth to self soothe. The anxiety is crazy, I feel so jittery and every little noise or movement makes me jump.

Any advice to distract myself (particularly something to do with my hands because of my OCD) during this difficult time would be appreciated.

So I called the shrink again and told her of my problems and she said it was a smart idea to call her and things went pretty fast by then.

I started by finally getting myself to diet, after starting to see some results I started running.  Everything started feeling better a bit.  Still no friends, and definitely no girls in my life, but it was something.  Since then I've lost 50 pounds and felt less stressed driving and at work.

A bit over a month ago, I got a call out of the blue for a dream job.  I was so eager and a few weeks ago I interviewed.  Especially after hating my current job it was a glimpse of hope.  I even had a friend that had gone to work for them a few months earlier.  We met a few months before he left and I felt connected with someone for once.  

Anyway, I went to the interview and it went okay, but I had felt I had screwed up knowing the key thing they were looking for.  I admittedly felt that it wasn't a great position for me exactly, but I was still fairly qualified, but no expert.  A week later I heard back and they didn't want me.  I wasn't a specialist enough.  Ever since the first day after the interview my life has been slipping away.

I haven't been able to keep up with my diet or exercise.  I get upset at people driving again.  I feel so much just dread of being at work.  I can't sleep.  It's like everything just went back and I'm completely fucked again.  On top of that my best friend (lives far away) has gotten a new boyfriend and no longer really talk to me anymore.

To make a long story short, I have done poorly in college for the past year and a half. I've been living with my parents so that I wouldn't have to deal with money issues while I was going to school. Getting through college should've been an easy task considering that I'd had a considerable amount of responsibility lifted off my shoulders, but I couldn't shake the depression, and now I'm faced with a difficult decision.

I want to drop out of school, and move out of the house. My parents are more and more dissapointed in me with each passing day, and my depression is getting worse because of it. I've been forcing myself to go to school every semester because I know it's what my parents want, but I just cannot muster up the motivation to succeed. I am scared for my future if I don't attend school right now, but I am also desperate to remove myself from this pattern of cyclical disappointment.

I've saved up about $2000 in my bank account. I know it's not much, but it's enough to get me a small apartment with a friend. I don't have many close friends, so I settled for my friend Bill, who's having financial issues of his own. He's a really nice guy, but he has a mild form of Asperger's, and he proudly refers to himself as a ""furry"". I don't judge him, and I've known him long enough that it doesn't bother me personally, but at the same time, I look at him, and I think to myself:

""Is *this* the person I want to live with? Is *this* the person who I want to sign a year-long lease on an apartment with? A naive, rudderless, misguided, financially-troubled, and (forgive me, Bill) ultimately, all-around weird guy?

I can overlook all of these things if me and Bill are just hanging out together. But committing to live with him is an entirely different story.

I feel like I have no other choice at this point. My parents are going to want me to leave after they find out that I've given up on school, and sharing an apartment with Bill would give both of us a chance to start saving money if we split the cost of rent between us. I'm fucking scared though. I have little to no experience with living on my own, and I doubt that Bill would be able to help me out much. He's been on his own for awhile now, but he barely manages to keep his head above the water.

Am I a fool for wanting to do this? Am I making a life decision that I will ultimately regret? Will I look back on this and say, ""Damn, I wish I would've just fought that depression and gone to school. Now it's too late to go back, and I've missed my window of opportunity. I wonder what my life would've been like if I'd done what everybody told me was the 'right' thing to do...""",depression,t5_2qqqf,About to move out of my house for the first time.

Then after just a few months I was sent to an foster place until someone found me and adopted at 2.

Fast forward to puberty and beyond. Never any luck with the girls. Or ladies; I had a preference for the older ones most of my life.

Not to win over their vajajay in some sick way; just out of anger once they make even the most trivial misstep that supposedly wrongs me; or if they committ a perceived injustice against anyone.

Naturally, I just perpetuate a vicious cycle; I troll or spew vitriol about females, they react negatively and criticize or retaliate in kind, further ""confirming"" the supposed ""truths"" my mind has; and on and on and on.

I stumbled upon this sub today, and I can't stop thinking. Is there a difference between sexual assault and rape? I haven't been able to call it that. Even though I know that's probably what it is. 

I've had the worst experience as I'm sure many of you have also had. 

I tried to report my case only to have it mishandled and I was harassed by the initial detective. I was stalked and harassed by one of the men who assaulted me, and my best friend who drugged me in the first place has just stopped contacting me. 

I've just recently started feeling better and hopped back on the social media, even uploaded a new picture as a start of some sort of new chapter. I saw her face and It just all started coming back. 

With no support system at home I've traveled 99 miles away from home to go to college and seek counseling for myself. Only have been to one session so far.

I have a roommate, and right now I can't stop the flashbacks. I can't stop crying. I'm sitting in the dorm restrooms crying as quietly as I can. 

I'm writing here to kind of...check in I guess. Maybe it's the first step to calling it what it is? Maybe it's a first step to forgetting it ever happened. It's ruining my life. I haven't showered in days because I hate to undress myself. I still hear them chanting.

I think I'm going to delete my social media accounts again. I don't want to see her face in pictures or comments. I feel like I can't escape. 

I know there are others who are conquering this, I want to be like you one day. I just feel like I'm in a hole. I want to get out, but I feel like there's no way out. I've thought about ""that"" way out, but I can't do that to my friends. They know something is wrong and even though they don't help a lot I know they will feel bad... i don't want to hurt anyone. 

I'm angry, sad, upset, and frustrated. Why, why is it that these people can get away with it while I can't even enjoy the comfort of taking a shower. Normal everyday things are torture. Certain words are little triggers for bullets and rounds of flashbacks that I can't stop. Even some hair cuts and smells I can't stand. I hate the color yellow now, like those bedsheets. I'm worried for the day someone says ""hey I saw this video of you..."" but at the same time hoping there'd be enough footage to lock someone up. 

I'm tired. I'm impatient I know... i just want to take a shower without feeling disgusting. Without trying to scratch that filth off of me.

I am 18, diagnosed anxiety and depression, a self harmer and a have had a few suicide attempts in the past months. I am currently being cared for by my care coordinator and am on 40mg of Fluoxetine. I was quickly taken into a day hospital (somewhere I could be kept safe during working hours until my family was home to watch over me) by my Adult Mental Health Center after my assessor found out one of the ways I was hurting myself was by hitting my head very hard again solid or sharp surfaces, due to concern of permanent brain damage and I could not be trusted on my own. 

I was always very academic, and it was all I ever used to be good at. However now I'm trying to slowly get back into my 'normal' life I have absolutely no attention span, an awful memory, go through phases of non-stop talking and incredible bursts of energy when I cant sit still or cant stop laughing for no reasons, I'm really struggling to form sentences clearly (this is taking me forever to try and write correctly) and all of this is terrifying me considering I have A Level exams in a few months and on some days I cant even read or form a sentence without struggling. 

All of this is making me feel even more suicidal because I had plans on University. Studying and essay writing is all I've done in my life and now I cant even do that. 

I was wondering if others have experienced this or have any idea if its a side effect of fluoxetine, depression, anxiety or perhaps I did damage my head?

For example, I just quarrelled with my girlfriend and now I feel like I just want to kill myself and stop all these sadness and despair and hurt, but the only thing stopping me is that I know I will hurt my family members who love me. I literally have to use mental strength to push away the thought of wanting to kill myself.

Recently for the past 6 weeks or so I cry almost every day over silly things, some times over nothing at all, like maybe I'm just looking for an excuse to cry. I feel lonely and misunderstood all the time, except when I'm physically with my SO, then I feel much better and occasionally even happy when she's holding my hand and hugging me and kissing me. The moment she leaves my side, even when we're still texting, I go back to feeling lonely. I also don't want to meet anybody else except for a selected two friends.

Today I felt nothing, like I was just going through the motions. I've been feeling these up and downs for about 1.5 years now, but 1 month ago it got very bad till I might as well have committed suicide, and just 1 week ago I tried to overdose on pills but stopped halfway. I feel like aside from the crying, it's getting better most days because I no longer feel so empty like I did last year. The only thing that has truly gotten worst is how often I think of ending my life, and how happy I would be if my life was taken away. Just one quarrel with my SO can make me feel this way. 

I wish I could snap out of it but I feel like I'm just stuck in this routine of crying, being sad, being happy momentarily, then feeling nothing, and more crying. It's not something that I want. I feel like something is really wrong with me, and I am so alone. I have many things that I'm supposed to look forward to, but I don't seem to really care, or my excitement fluctuates and I tend to skip going to these things altogether at the last minute.

About 1.5 months ago I started seeing two different therapists, and one of them was going to diagnose me with mild depression while the other wanted me to go for some physical tests because he suspected cyclothymia. I'm not sure I even have any of those, it doesn't feel like I'm sick, just that I'm stuck somewhere and I can't really get out of it. I'm afraid to going back to seeing a therapist due to some things my friends have said to me, and I was not comfortable with both the therapists I went to. It's also really expensive where I live. I'm a college student though, so I could probably try my university health centre but I've heard so many bad things about it. Can anybody help me or tell me what to do?",depression,t5_2qqqf,"What's wrong with me, could I be depressed?"

In the past 6 months however its reached a point where I can barely continue on with my life. I've been using all the energy I have to get up and go to work and try to deal with my days. 

Two days ago I did something that I shouldn't have done... It was terrifying and I honestly don't know if I want to feel how I did ever again. I've gone so long without telling anyone how I feel. I tried to tell my mom a year ago but, at that point she didn't think anything of it. After the other day I told her I needed help. I told her I didn't want to continue on with my life anymore and I was scared and didn't know what to do.

I've hurt so many people by keeping this huge barrier between myself and anyone who has come into my life in these past years. I'm even pushing away the few people who haven't given up on me yet and I don't want to hurt them anymore. I don't want to be alone.

When I went in for my appointment, my ADHD improved with the Vyvanse, but my GDS score was 15, which is still fairly high, and I've been having a lot of extreme mood swings (my boyfriend has told me that he doesn't know how I will be from hour to hour and can't figure out if he should talk to me, leave me alone, or if he should just move to a different state, lol).

I've read about Fetzima and it seems to be an SNRI that is used for short-term treatment. My PDoc gave me sample boxes that he had from a drug rep, so not an actual prescription, and I'm wondering if he's just trying the short-term meds out to see if I respond to an SNRI better than an SSRI before he writes a long-term prescription?

I didn't do anything... So why do I have to write about how much I want to kill myself in r/depression? Why do I have to seek attention and people to notice me? I hate myself so much. I was active in the r/mnfh chat room for around two or three months. Met some pretty great people on there, some of them I called friends. But I was always treating myself has less in presence of them, how ugly I am, how worthless, how much of a fault I am. They tried to help, they really tried but I didn't listen.

Last week I ended those friendships. They didn't deserve me rambling about how pathetic I am, people has their own life why would I deserve to be part of them if all I want is to die?

But loneliness gets to me, I need attention, I am sorry. My family doesn't know how I feel nor they will ever know even if I have been living with them all my life they will never know. 

I am looking for something, I don't know what I am looking for but it's something. I am still here and I probably will be here until fates comes for me. I don't have the strength to kill myself, but I also don't have the strength to live.

What do I do? I can't get better, and to be honest I don't want to... Why? Because if I really wanted to get better I would have been taking my meds. Meds for my hypertension and for my depression. I simply don't want to get better. I have been so sad for so much time, I simply can't get better, I don't know anything else.

This isn't life, spending time in front of a computer or just being in bed. Why did I got this gift that I don't want? Why does people that want this gift that is life can't get it? I would trade places with them without even thinking about it.

So what do I do know? There are so many things about me that I haven't said. Why would anyone put their time on me? Why should them waste that time with a pathetic assh*le like me?

I've still managed to go into work 2 days this week which was a real challenge. I did end up discreetly crying and having panic attacks, but I managed to time these little episodes with bathroom breaks or short moments where my coworkers left the room and I could break down a little bit. Sort of like blowing off a bit of steam so later I didn't outright explode I guess.
Nobody noticed or heard my little crying/panic spells and I managed to function relatively normally, although everyone kept saying I looked tired and a bit peaky. I blamed this on the lurgy everyone seems to be getting lately. I'm quite proud of myself for making it in, and for holding out until I got home to have a really big sob.

It's so tiring being on edge all the time and feeling the adrenaline thrumming through my veins. I can't sleep well as I'm so alert every little sound wakes me up or prevents me falling asleep. Plus I'm feeling cold all the time (English weather doesn't help!) as I seem to have constant goosebumps? The hairs on my body are literally standing up with fear it seems. Even weirder I found a patch of my eyebrow hair is starting to grow in white and one of my eyelashes is white. Is that down to stress? I'm really jumpy and jittery, so I hope my hair doesn't start turning white, although if it does I'll just pretend it's a fashion thing ;)

Anyway literally ten minutes ago I left my house and went into the garage despite the snow on the ground and it being 2am. I couldn't cope any more with the sleep deprivation and the constant high level anxiety always bordering on hyperventilation. I started looking around at all the things my father keeps in there that I could potentially kill myself with. All the ropes, random chemicals, knives and tools... I definitely was in a very dark place and considering ending it all. Before I committed to the plan I made in my mind

But then I could hear my rabbits kicking in their hutch and although it was really hard to pull myself away from the potential relief, I couldn't focus on causing myself harm when I had the image of their four twitchy fluffy noses all snuggling up in their hay bed together. I really do love my animals, sometimes I think they have more humanity than humans, and I think my animals have saved me more times than anyone. So, for tonight at least, I'm still here.

My fault; absolutely. But never the less I really tried to bounce back from it. I never had the intention of doing this kind of thing and I was still really grateful for the job. Fast forward to now 7-8 months later. I still feel an insane amount of crushing guilt that is really harming my mental state, and it also has effected my work. Communication was never a big thing in my department and also since we are working in a different language there is little I can do. I am still trying my hardest but I am also filled with anger. Angry at myself, but also angry at my boss. I shouldn't be but yeah I feel betrayed. The conflicting feelings that what happened to me was my fault for being out, but that the action visited on me was not my fault gives me this insane amount of guilt with this intense anger. And I feel a bit ignored. 

There is also a new girl who came to help. She's a bit higher level than me but I'm teaching her the ins and outs of my job. My other boss (not the one I'm complaining about) says I have nothing to worry about, but I doubt they would tell me at this stage if I did.

What i am trying to say is... .well i actually don't know. I don't know why i am still typing this and i do not know what will come of it. I want to branch out socially but i am fearful of results as i have been crushed easily before. Now i am just typing to fill up time. 

tl;dr  sad because life is very hard for me. Have no friends to talk to. Looking for someone to talk to via steam or something. Tired of being alone.

I figured this would be a good place to post this.
My grandpa committed suicide before I was born. It was after he got hooked up to a dialysis machine. He put a shotgun in his mouth (presumably out back somehow?) and pulled the trigger. I take it he left a suicide note because my family knows why he did it. How can you be ""alive"" when you can't even wipe your own ass. I'm not sure how everyone would view this act but I find it strangely noble because He killed himself to preserve his dignity. I'm not saying suicide is okay, but theres always the special cases right.
As I grew up, I understood what suicide was but I never understood why one would do it. Even when my parents split up in highschool and I was a trainwreck of emotions, depression wasn't there. I remember looking out the window and thinking, ""do i want to kill myself?"" then immediately asking myself ""why?""
then my legs started to swell and of course i ignored it. It started to get out of hand so I asked the doctors. They ran some tests and told me i had lymphedema. In short, my lymph nodes in my legs weren't efficient enough to return all the water back to my heart so they swell up during the day. Its under control now but I have to look at them everyday. Th-they are so god damn unattractive. Then I got word of my fatty liver disease and I broke on some level at that point. Depression started to set it.
I had been working at a shitty unionized job for 5 years and had received nothing from it (still working there, i can feel it taking a toll on me) and barely gone to college after i graduated. I don't even know where I want to be in a year, 5 years, 20 years. And to make it all worse, I've fallen for someone I've fucked up in the past to much to salvage anything more then friendship out of.
I guess to sum it up, I feel lost. I have never made plans to kill myself, or harm myself. I have never been all the inclined to kill myself, but i have fantasized about the idea of non-existence. I feel like its a stepping stone into something greater if I don't fix this. I have a counselor already but the thing about a counselor is that half of the help they give is actually coming from yourself, and when you can't come up with the answers to questions, there's only so much progress to be made.
TL;DR It feels nice to get this in writing, thoughts? I guess?

I dread going to work every day. Unfortunately, in my geographical area and given the skills and training I have, I am limited somewhat with what I can do if I want to continue making the salary I make.

What has this depression looked like? I've stopped taking care of my home, my appearance, my personal hygiene, and my self-care. I'm a teacher, and I had been gradually losing weight starting at the end of the last school year (when I could see the light at the end of the tunnel), and that weight loss continued over the summer, to the point that I lost 48 pounds. Since the start of this school year, I've regained 35 of those pounds. 

But here is what I realized today. I am letting a job I hate 8 hours a day ruin the entire 24 hours of a workday, plus the weekends! I may be somewhat locked in to my current job *for right now,* but what good does it do to sabotage the rest of my day because of it? I will tell you this - I hate my job even more when I am regaining weight, poorly dressed, not freshly showered, and eating and sleeping like shit. 

I've decided I just can't treat myself like this anymore. My real job is myself. To put myself in bed for eight hours a day. To make myself shower once a day. To eat healthfully. To look as well as I can, perhaps even wear makeup. Maybe, when I feel better, my job won't be so awful. Maybe, when I feel better, my job will be just as awful, but I will see other options available. Maybe the job will suck just as bad and my options maybe just as limited, but maybe I will at least feel good while I am not at work. 

I also have a psychiatry appointment on Monday. That took a few weeks to get. Depression meds really haven't helped me in the past, but regardless of the medication, I think I'm just going to need to white knuckle through this and do it until the motivation comes. If I can make myself get to work, I can make myself shower. And I'm going to.",depression,t5_2qqqf,A revelation

I posted on here about 3 months ago, from a very dark place. I had recently broken up with an asshat of a boyfriend, who just found it to be too time consuming to be there. Exactly one week later, I was raped, confused and lost. I tried to drink myself to death on an entire bottle of nyquil, panicked and ended up in the ER. 

I have spent a year struggling with severe anxiety about schoolwork, grades, friends, and my social life. Everything was crippling to work through and the harder I pushed myself, the harder it became to keep working through the monotony. 

Rewind to a month before the breakup. I revealed to my 5 closest friends that I had been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, and had been recommended treatments. The moment they heard it was like I didn't exist anymore. These were the people I spent all my time with, and they couldn't handle me having problems, and cut me out completely. 

I have struggled with anorexia as well, weighing just over 100 lbs at 5'5"". I turned to it again as a coping mechanism. I had no one who cared or was there to help me, and I isolated myself in even more. I spent all of my time alone and did nothing. The months following the rape were the worst. I developed PTSD, became introverted, spoke rarely, and didn't reach out to anyone about what was going on. I became an insomniac. 

Everyone has them, those moments right before you fall asleep where you think about your life and everything going on? Those were my worst nightmare. I couldn't stop reliving what had happened, over and over and crying and shaking. I was terrified and absolutely paralyzed by that fear. 

I reached a point where I thought there was no hope. There was nobody there who cared, I was alone and all I wanted was the pain to stop. Nothing I read could make me rethink my decision. I planned it all out. 

And then, time just passed. I have no idea how or what happened but I resolved to go home. I spent winter break at home. I cut everyone off for 2 months, rarely talking. I began eating again, I started to draw, I found things that made me happy. 

This is your only life, regardless of your religion, you'll never be back in this situation again. This is your only chance to do what dreams and hopes you have. I know the pain, it is crippling, it makes it impossible to move or do anything, thinking is just so damn hard. I know the feeling of being trapped in your own skin, unable to change your feelings and unable to do anything about it. Trapped. 

And i also know that had I done what I had planned I would have never lived to come back and see who was waiting for me. I confronted my friends about their behavior, and told them what happened. They looked into it and came around. I made new friends, some of the best i've ever had. I met someone new, I got back on track academically, and I controlled my anxiety. I was back.

But none of that matters. If there's one piece of advice I can give you, it's something my friend told me when I told her everything. 

""do you think its going to matter if you get thinner, or prettier? Is it going to make you feel any better about yourself? What about if you work harder, is it going to make any difference to you? 

None of it matters. Now think about how much of a difference it would make on your life if you embraced what you have and were happy.""

So thank you reddit. Thank you for giving me the courage and the support to get back on my feet, and start to take off the burden that is depression. Thank you for making me feel beautiful and loved and helping me. Thank you for letting me live my life. And most of all, thank you for helping me be happy. :)

The past two days I called into work because I haven't been feeling well and my boss said that if I couldn't provide a doctor's note, I would be at risk to lose my job. Obviously, this was really hard news anyway and I ended up being really frantic on the phone and freaked out on her, making things worse. I spent the past 24 hours without sleep, faking a doctor's note, and I have to say it looks damn good. I know the risks involved. I just started school a few days ago, finally near 25 I'm trying to better my life. I sort of sprung it on them because the process happened really quickly. I filled out my FAFSA and was enrolled in 48 hours and told them as soon as possible. So when I heard that I could lose my job, I just spiraled. I never thought about bettering my future because I always thought what's the point? I'll probably kill myself in the next few years anyway. It was a big step for me to go, because it was me definitively saying I'm not going to kill myself. Then with the possibility of losing my job, I couldn't afford to go to school anymore. So I eventually got the nerve to call my boss again and try to work things out. I apologized and let her know that I just couldn't afford to go to the doctor because I don't have health care and I often go hungry waiting for my next check, which is completely true and embarrassing to admit. But it turns out that she was never going to fire me, just counsel me and I freaked out for no reason, which made me feel kind of worse in a way. I'm thankful that I will keep my job, but just the utter humiliation I feel now is just the next big thing in my mind. I know things will be okay, but I still am having trouble keeping calm. Sometimes it's all too much. Because of my emotions, I try to keep my life as stress free and isolating as possible so as to not exacerbate things.

I met a drugged up and drunk girl in a bar while I was drugged up and drunk myself on the night where I decided to end my life. I felt like the situation with my ex-wife left me so emotionally damaged that I simply didn't care about myself anymore, and I was full of all kinds of substances and blacking out.

Anyway, for those willing to read, here's the story with my ex-wife, because it's relevant to what's going on now:

http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2lolh7/help_my_wife_came_back_from_abroad_in_a/

So we got divorced after a very traumatizing process, she left the country, got her parents to send me threats day in/day out for money I don't owe her, and told me that they would look for me, find me, mess up my life for the rest of my life, etc.. and that I was trapped where I live. Since I have very serious OCD, anxiety, depression, and phobias, one of my biggest phobias is being trapped in a place, and my depression got massive.

This is what happened about 3 weeks ago: I go to a bar completely plastered and meet this girl who was very into me, and very attractive physically. Before I know it, she's in a cab with me. Then in my house. Then she sees the squalor I was living in and offers to clean the whole place. Then she needed a place to crash for a while, and I accepted. So we became ""friends with benefits"" or whatever it's called.

Turns out that she told me all about her messed up past, and her alcoholism, abusive ex boyfriend, three kids, being promiscuous, etc.. She is not a psycho like my ex-wife. She likes to spoil me with breakfast, dinner, does the laundry, she cleaned the whole house (including the nastiest places of the apartment), is very affectionate, etc.. but she's always broke and likes to drink and smoke pot. She also cries a lot and I fear is not very honest at all. Nothing wrong with the pot, and I haven't seen her overdo the alcohol, save for one time when she made a scene in front of diplomats (long story - it was not an aggressive scene, just her almost falling on her ass quite a few times).

She's trying to take care of me, and the apartment looks brand new, and I feel taken care off in the midst of my funk. However, there's something very shady about her, and now she told me that she doesn't know what do to, where to go, she has no money (I know this, I've been helping her out with very little since I still don't know her very well).

She has a job with ""dangerous people"", so she says. I don't what to think, and keep on contemplating suicide. I'm a professional at making bad decisions, and fear that I made my worst one to date. I don't even know if reddit can save my life this time around like it did last time.

TL;DR - I'm clinically depressed, went from being married to a dangerous psychopath to being ""friends with benefits"" to a broke and possible dangerous girl.",depression,t5_2qqqf,Help: I [35M]went from a relationship [26F] where I almost ended up dead to another relationship [29F] that I fear might leave me dead.

How do you deal with it when you find out that you were betrayed exactly how you thought you were, though? How are you supposed to cope with that?

My ex, the guy I loved more than fucking anything and convinced myself to trust, made this massive deal about me acquiring a fuckbuddy after we broke up. I told him for honesty's sake. The fuckbuddy knows I love someone else, I don't feel anything romantic for him.

When I told my ex about this he was massively upset. Said he couldn't speak to me so I had to go silent for a week, said he wished he could hate me, wished he'd never loved me.

There's this girl who lives near him that I could tell was throwing herself at him like a fucking whore and everyone including him told me it was my mind, I was being paranoid, but I found out today he's  been doing stuff with her as long as I've been fucking this other guy and he fucking lied. He travels seven hours every weekend just to see her, bought her a personalised birthday cake when he'd only lived near her like three months at the time, is on a two month holiday with her right now, calls her princess and all the other nicknames he called me.

If he'd been honest and said it was happening I wouldn't have given as much of a shit. its the fact that someone who insisted i trust them, who insisted they had my recovery and best interests at heart, the person I convinced myself to love after being treated like shit my whole life, has been lying to me cause he'd rather defend some loose-arsed hairy bitch than the person who will happily miss sleep to offer him emotional support, knows what he's been through in his life and can empathise]

fuck him fuck him fuck him fuck him fuck him fuck him. whats the point of trusting when it always turns out like this. how am i supposed to trust anyone when the person i trusted most doesn't want to see me for fourteen months and prefers that I'd think I was psychotic than admit he's a fucking hypocrite

We talked for a while blasted some tunes, and swapped war stories of the week just passed. We drank some more. We started talking in quieter voices. We started talking about darker things.

My friend, ""R"", opened up to me about a lot of things, and I opened up to him as well. He told me about how he doesn't think he's ever been really, deeply happy. At least not often. He's only ever dated people because they wanted his help in some way. He has no real passions in life. He'd be bored if there was a memory of something better.

What we came to (and we were drunk, so maybe take this with a grain of salt) was that he needed to find his things. Everyone has things that make them happy, and these things range all over the place, and manifest in all kinds of ways. But no one is born knowing what these things are. People discover they love jazz when they go to a jazz show. They discover painting is their passion when they spill ketchup on a napkin and start drawing. You have to find your things.

We think that R just hasn't stumbled upon his interests. Its a big world, and we're young. How much could we have seen? And I'm betting this could apply to a lot of people here. Lord knows it applies to me.

I know this isn't a real solution for a lot of us. It isn't meant to be. It's meant to help. There are so many things in the world that we have never seen, and there are so many things to make a person happy. Is skydiving your thing? How would you know if you haven't done it. Do you enjoy rebinding old books? I bet you don't know.

Again, I know this isn't an answer to anything. Its just my way of trying to help. Thats all we can really try to do in the end. Solutions come from you, we all just want to make it easier to get.",depression,t5_2qqqf,"Alright friends, it's story time."

Starting with the basic problems, more or less. I'm depressed and have been for almost a year and a half. I had never thought about it before, but more recently I realized I had felt the way I do now for a lot longer than I have been depressed. I lived with feelings of passivity and self doubt or self loathing. I know they're not the same, but overall it was a feeling of worthlessness. I had only been able to deal with it until something else made a massive blow of a confirmation. A girl asked me out. I didn't ask her out. She asked me. I never had any expectation for that to happen. After about three months she broke up with me. It absolutely destroyed me. 

I became obsessed. I tried so hard to get her back. As this was my junior year and her senior year, what would happen was inevitable. She graduated. Let's step back for a second. I doubt that anyone would actually care enough to read this, but I figure at this point a person would wonder, ""Why did she break up with you?"" And that my dear readers is a wonderful question that I wish I had an answer to. That is part of what makes all of this so difficult.

I digress. So she graduated and I am left there with nothing but a phone number and an obsession. I keep on talking to her, just casually even though I am so desperate to try and reach a point to get her back. However, I made multiple attempts in my stupidity and desperation, all of which failed. Moreover, I'm not exactly the coolest guy you will ever meet. I'm not even cool.

Now for some typical things. I'm a teenage guy. I don't get my ""needs"" fulfilled. I suppose I don't need to have vague words. I mean sex. I haven't ever gotten that need fulfilled. So a lot of weird ideas go through my head. So... Kinky types of stuff that I have never gotten to try. As a quick sidestep to talk about my wants in kink. I wished for her to sit on my face. I don't know why, but I have. I've wanted to lick her face. 

As for her, I stopped talking to her a few months ago. But just because I stopped talking to her doesn't mean I stopped feeling so strongly, keeping watch, and obsessing over her. So I have a few questions about all of this myself. Had I told her I love her sooner, would things be different? Would she still be with me? Or is it more likely that she didn't love me like I loved her? Did she ever even actually love me?

And reaching this point, it gets very weird and challenging. I started dating this girl I met at all county honor band. It's only been one date, but still, with a girl you would figure I would start to think about my ex less. However, I still obsess, as evidenced by the mere fact that I am making this post. Most of my thoughts now are lead by obsession over her and asking whomever may be able to understand me somehow to ""please kill me."" I just can't take this anymore. To be a  wordsmith, this body confines me as a tomb of misery.  Please, just release me from this pain and suffering.

Trying to even start to fix this was near impossible. I have such immense social anxiety as well as the passivity I mentioned earlier. So simply asking my mom for therapy was hard enough. Talking to my therapist is even more difficult. I've reached a point where I am on anti-depressants, however, I don't think they are helping me at all. Perhaps it's my own head causing the problem. 

I hate my life. Please, help me. I have no future left to live.",depression,t5_2qqqf,I'm still obsessed and it will more than likely be the death of me.

I was sexually abused by a neighbour on a regular basis between the age of 9 and 13. I had fantastic parents who would often be out at the casino for days on end and leave us in the care of this man. To them it was a free baby sitter - what could possibly go wrong? Things started off slowly. Just touching. Then on my 10th birthday, he gave me a ""present"" (his words) by taking my virginity. What a great birthday present - something I am going to remember for the rest of my life. Unfortunately, that wasn't the worst thing to happen. I'm not sure how old I was maybe 11 or 12 but I guess he was growing tired of me and decided that he'd share me with some of his friends. One of them was pretty sadistic. He put out his cigarette on my thigh, another permanent reminder. I was just a little sex doll for these perverts, some nights they'd all have a go other times it would be one or two of them. It didn't happen all that often, maybe between once a fortnight to a month. I have tried repressing these memories. Just after I turned 13 he suddenly packed up and moved. I was relieved in a way that the abuse was going to stop, but at the same time I felt abandoned, rejected and unloved. He would always tell me how much he cared about me and this is what people who cared about each other did. So when he left I felt like crap. I never told anyone what happened. I was sworn to secrecy. My parents suspected nothing - they were too caught up in their addiction. 

I had an extremely abusive mother who would beat me for the smallest thing. Once I had a week off school because she slapped me across the face with her shoe. She hit me so hard it left an impression of the sole on my face that lasted for days. This happened when I was eight? My dad was working away. When ever dad was away she'd become exceptionally violent. I guess this is why I didn't say anything about the neighbour, I just wanted to feel ""loved"". Though, not having an understanding of what love actually is, I took his word for it.

When the abuse happened my feelings were all over the place I had good feeling and bad feelings. I was getting love and attention from an adult which made me feel good but at the same time when he was forcing himself into me it hurt - why would he want to hurt me even after I told him it was hurting? So much confusion. When I was 14 the reality of what had happened to me started to kick in. I began to develop feelings of overwhelming shame, guilt, loneliness, dirtiness, self-hatred, unloved, abandoned (still funnily enough) my self-esteem plummeted and I felt dead inside. This is when I started cutting. First it was little cuts that barely broke the skin, this eventually escalated to deeper cuts and burns on my arms, breasts and thighs. Most of them were well hidden. I have continued cutting ever since.

Cutting only helped a little bit. It was more so instant gratification than anything long term. So then at 15 I turned to drugs. Weed and alcohol initially. Then at 16 I tried heroin and cocaine. I didn't care much for the heroin but the cocaine wasn't horrible. Though in order to get it I had to hang around with the wrong people. This led to indiscriminate unenjoyable sex with men. Which only lowered my self worth further. There came a point where I was over everything. I was 18 and felt like I had nothing to offer the world and the world had nothing to offer me. I was going to end it. Sometimes I wonder if it is unfortunate or lucky that it was a failed attempt. None the less it wasn't successful - obviously. By 22 my life was spiralling out of control. I was drinking tequila before work, sometimes on my lunch break. After work I would have a line and head to the pub, where I would drink into the wee hours of the night. 

At 23 I was actually feeling really good. I decided to move in with a friend I had known for ages. He had always been a great guy. We had all night drinking sessions quite a bit. I started going out more and more, and sometimes I'd bring guys home. I didn't realise at the time that this friend had strong feelings for me and by bringing guys home he was becoming incredibly jealous. I thought we were just friends. Then one night he snapped in worst possible way. He had been binging on alcohol and meth when it happened.

I got home from a night out. I was relatively sober as I was the driver. Headed straight to my room, as I passed him he told me that I looked really pretty I didn't think anything of it and said thanks. I grabbed my towel and headed to the shower. Once I was done I walked back to my room with just the towel on. There he was sitting on my bed. He began telling me how much he liked me and that it wasn't fair that I was teasing him. I explained to him that nothing was ever going to happen between us because I only saw him as a friend. I sat down next to him and patted his back and told him I was sorry for not feeling the same way etc. He kind of sighed and asked for a hug. So I gave him a hug. That was a huge mistake on my part. 

He tightened his grip on me and forced me on to the bed. He got on top of me and punched me several times in the face. He kept telling me that I shouldn't have teased him. He ripped open the towel while holding my throat pining me down. I tried not fight back. I didn't want to be hit again. I tried to keep my legs squeezed together but he managed to force them open enough to get his fingers inside of me. I struggled. He tightened his grip on my throat. I almost passed out. So I stopped resisting. I just let him do what he wanted. He'd slap my face and stuck his fingers in my mouth. He took the belt off his jeans and wrapped it around my neck. He rolled me on to my stomach like I was some sort of dog. He pulled the belt tight as he unzipped himself. He tried to get me to perform oral on him, I wasn't going to open my mouth for him. But the more I refused the tighter the belt got. Eventually I passed out. He continued to have his way with my unconscious body. I woke up in pain with him inside of me. He finished and rolled off of me. I wish I could say that was the end of it. I just laid there. Disgusted. Ashamed. Dirty. After he passed out I got up put on some clothes and got the fuck out of there and never looked back. Again being the weak person I am I never told anyone what had actually happened.

I gave up on everything after that. I reverted into my own little world I stopped going out. I avoided friends and family as much as I could. I cleaned up my act. Stopped drinking, stopped the drugs, stopped the random sex. I started working a second job to keep myself and my mind busy. I finally managed to buy my own home. I got settled in and my life was slowly coming together. My mind began to clear up. Took me a while but at 27 I decided it was time to get in to the dating scene and find myself a partner. I went on a few dates, I just did not feel comfortable with any of them. I still couldn't stand the thought of having someone touch me at that point, so it was a little awkward sometimes. Finally, I found someone that I really connected with. 

We took things pretty slowly in terms of physical affection. We would happily sit on the couch in our own bubbles and watch a movie. This was great! Unfortunately, the first time we had sex I felt awful, I froze up and sort of just let him do his thing. I think I should have waited a little longer. None the less, I eventually became more comfortable with him and we were able to become more affectionate towards each other after many months. He moved in and things were going great for a while. Then the black dog came back into my life. I started receiving private messages from my rapist. I ignored them and blocked him, but he'd always create a new account. I began having flashbacks of my childhood abuse and rape and severe night terrors. I began having mood swings and severe anxiety attacks and I was cutting again. I'd snap at my partner for no reason. I bit the bullet and arranged to see a therapist. I had seen them in the past but felt they did nothing for me. Still, I wanted to make an effort. 

One night, however, things at home reached boiling point. We had an argument, I told him to pack his things and leave. He called my bluff and said fine. I was so angry at myself, I wanted to hurt myself so badly, so I punched a wall. I think this really scared him. It scared me. This was the first time I had ever let anyone see me so upset. I calmed down quickly and tried to resolve the issue. Eventually we both went back to bed. He asked me why I was getting therapy. I had initially told him that it was because of my parents (mainly my abusive mother). He said there had to be more to it. I told him there was, but I didn't have it in me to tell him what it was. The next day I wrote him a letter explaining the childhood abuse. I didn't mention the rape because I still just wanted to forget it.  

That wasn't going to happen, every few weeks I was still getting pms. At first they started out innocent enough, apologising. But the more I kept ignoring him the more violent and grotesque they got. I eventually confided in my partner that I had been getting harassing messages, without going in to detail. He told me to call the cops. I was reluctant. But the messages kept coming. Finally, I reported the messages to the police, though before I did I told my partner of why I was reluctant, basically that he forced himself on me and I let it happen - I don't think he understood the severity of the situation, I didn't give him much to go on. Because of the nature of the messages I had to go in to the police station. 

The police immediately issued a police order against him and started organising a restraining order. While I was making my statement one of the officers from the sex crimes unit spoke to me. She asked me if I wanted to report anything other than the messages. I told her no. She looked me square in the eye and said ""Love, these messages are very incriminating. If he hurt you in the past you can have him charged"". Tears just started pouring out. I became a blubbering mess. After I regained my composure, I told her what had happened four years ago. It was hard saying the words, but I managed to get them out. She comforted me and told me they would work on making a case for the rape and assault as well as the harassment . I went home. My partner was away. I curled up into a ball and just sobbed myself to sleep.

The next day I received another message from my rapist threatening to kill me for contacting the police. As far as I am aware this was just because of the police order. I contacted the police and they were sent to charge him with breaching a police order and they were going to issue him with a restraining order. When they arrived at his house and tried to do their job apparently he lashed out punching a female police officer. Well that just set the whole thing in motion. He was arrested and they found a knife of some sort on him. They searched his house and found two unlicensed firearms and drugs. They seized his computer. This is were it gets disturbing. 

Turns out that he had set up cameras in the bedroom I was staying in when I lived with him and in the bathroom. Not only had he recorded me on my own and with other men - he had recorded the rape and actually kept it on his computer. When I found out I was distraught. Thinking about whether or not he posted it on the internet. How many other people had seen it. Who else was going to see it. I felt like I was being raped all over again. I was told that this would make the case a lot stronger. I became reluctant. It didn't matter. Where I live rape is a crime against the state so they don't need a victim to press charges. They were going to go a head with it either way. So I felt obligated to see it through. 

He didn't get bail. So I felt safe in that regard, but still so vulnerable. In preparation for the prosecution I was asked to walk them through what happened. They made me watch the video I only got half way through it before I had to throw up. I left I couldn't watch the rest. I came back the next day and sat through the rest of it. So much more happened than I remembered. It lasted a lot longer than I recalled. Then again he did choke me out. I didn't realise that he had done it several times. I don't want to go into detail as it was pretty brutal. Then I had one of the prosecutors questioning me as if I was to blame - asking me why I didn't scream for help, why I didn't fight back, why I waited to leave, why I didn't report it straight away, why I didn't do this, why I didn't do that. He told me he was just preparing me for the defence. That they were going to make it seem like I wanted it and it was consensual. I didn't care it just made me feel worse and worse. Again, I went home to an emptyish house. Had my fur babies to cuddle, but my partner was away for work again. 

All this took its toll. Night terrors worsened. Sleep was already difficult to come by. Now it was almost impossible. I was afraid to close my eyes. My partner was very supportive. When he was home I felt safe. When he was away at work everything seemed to amplify. Fortunately just before the trial was due to begin my rapist had a change of heart and decided that he was going to change his plea to guilty. I went to court. The judge heard his plea. Though he still had to hear the evidence of the case so he could make a judgement on the sentence. They went through it quickly. Then the TV came out. The video was played. It felt like forever. I could see my rapist grinning at what he was seeing. He turned around to me and shot me a smile. I almost threw up. The judge saw and asked that he be removed from the court room. 

A few weeks later it was time to hear his sentence. He had a significant number of charges against him. I have to say I was happy with the sentence. He got 24 years. non parole period of 17. 

Convicted of – 

•	Possession of unlicensed firearms (two counts) 

•	Breaching a restraining order

•	Serious Assault

•	Threatening with intent to gain etc. (six counts)

•	Make a statement or act creating false apprehension as to existence of threat or danger (two counts)

•	Aggravated stalking

•	Aggravated assault with intent (two counts)

•	Aggravated sexual penetration without consent (two counts) 

•	Deprivation of liberty

•	Possession of surveillance device for unlawful use 

•	Using a carriage service to make a threat (eight counts)

•	Using a carriage service to menace, harass or cause offence (12 counts)

This all wrapped up in January. I feel like there is a weight of my shoulders. But at the same time I am still trying to come to terms with everything. I tried running away from it but that didn't work. I'm so grateful that I had the support of a caring partner throughout the end part.

**TL:DR;** Sexually abused by neighbour when I was 9-13. He shared me with his friends. He moved away. Messed me up big time. Life spiralled out of control. Self-harmed, became dependant on drugs, alcohol and meaningless sex with random men. At 23 moved in with an old friend. Brutally raped me. Left with nothing but the clothes on my back. Tried to get on with life. Bought a house, found a caring partner. Took 4 years after the rape for me to be intimate with anyone. Out of nowhere rapist contacts me, starts harassing me through instant messages. Eventually contact police. He is arrested and charged. Sentenced to 24 years with a non parole period of 17 years.

She had me say my positive qualities but I just didn't feel anything. i guess because I felt like they either common or relatively minor and unimportant, nothing major.

Eventually she tells me that I wrote her a letter telling her she should pack her bags and move out and that nobody would miss her. I swear to God, I have NO recollection of a letter. My mother confirmed that I did. I can't remember, at all. I really can't. I haven't changed my meds recently or anything like that.

But, unfortunately, it works the other way. When I'm feeling mostly okay-ish, there's the nagging thought in my head saying *""what if something happens to upset you now and you go back to where you were before?""*...it's almost predictably cyclical, but that doesn't make it any better.

To be honest, I don't really know why I'm posting this. Recently I've been feeling a little better but because i'm so accustomed to Depression, this feels weird, almost alien to me &  I've been desperately wanting to feel ""down"", desperately wanting to feel ""normal"" since. Has anyone else experienced this?

Another thing that's been happening recently is that I've REALLY been missing that girl, desperately wanting to talk to her, I think this has come up mainly because a few weeks ago she randomly messaged me out of the blue (which I absolutely loved, probably more than I let on. I experienced a real sense of euphoria). 

She said things like she couldn't stop thinking about me, asking me if I still had feelings for her (even though she stopped talking to me to get herself a boyfriend) & expressed a little jealously (that's how it came across anyway) when we talked about a  female friend of mine.

We planned to skype (her idea), that fell through, I grew depressed & suicidal almost instantly (it felt like coming down from a drugs high) and expressed my upset to her, she obviously felt a little guilt because her boyfriend got involved & messaged me to stop ""harassing her"", which I wasn't doing, intentionally anyway.

A few weeks later (last week) we planned to skype, once again it didn't happen but this time I didn't tell anyone we were planning to skype because then it wouldn't seem real & I wouldn't get sad. But now I want to talk & skype her, I really miss her, we've even told one another that we'd find it hard to truly say goodbye. 

I'm confused on what to do, Shall I message her? I'm afraid if I message her & I get a negative or no response I'll do something stupid again.  Sorry for rambling, there was no other way of explaining it. Thanks :)

 It's been two months since my last post, so in order to understand what's going on I'll fill you guys in.
(And just a heads-up, this post will probably take some time to read. )
So throughout September-November, I was always having those suicidal, vicious self-hating thoughts. I joined the school wrestling team in mid-November in order to a)try to keep myself from feeling like a fucking failure for not being in ANY organized sports at all my entire life b)doing it in the hopes that my abusive, racist, awful asshole ""friends"" would stop bullying me (see previous posts for more detail on that) c) doing it in the hopes that exercise=better mood and less crazy thoughts. I started seeing the school counsellor after I attempted to run in front of a speeding train (she helped my stave off my craziness for just a bit, and talking to her in person helped). I also joined the debate team, hoping to prove my worthless self amongst a sea of people that seem to be smarter, more fun, more attractive and just better than me in every way.
The wrestling thing isn't going well. At all. For starters, I'm a tiny, useless stick at 105 lbs and 64 inches, and the next smallest person on the team is at least 20 pounds heavier. So you can imagine how much my ass got kicked. I tried,I fought and I even won 4-5 practice matches, but the truth stood; my skinny ass was never meant for this. On December 1st (coincidentally my mum's birthday) we went from doing small, chillaxed practice matches where we'd halfheartedly practice moves on each other to full -blown, no holds barred live wrestling. The first time I did it I lost all four matches. Badly. And you know what I did afterwards? I ran to the bathroom after practice and just cried. Cried because I was a walking skeleton that people would keep around just out of pity. Cried because no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't keep a consistent workout routine to lose said skeleton body and gain a more muscular one. Whenever I try to workout, I just start self-hating on myself until I have no energy to exercise anymore. But this doesn't happen most of the time, because I can never get the focus required to workout. I've tried alarms, notes, reminders, /r/GetMotivated and all that shit but I just won't work on me. Because I can't focus on anything, I'll stay with this hideous paki body until i'm dead. sucks to be me, i guess
The newfound body-image shit, the suicidal thoughts, the anxiety about having my parents finding out my religious beliefs, the bullying and the extreme mood swings that sent me from actively suicidal and hopeless to happy to calm and everything in between finally made me snap. The next morning, my parents dropped me off a bit of a walk away from the school. I took advantage of this opportunity to try and muster up the courage to off myself. I tried jumping off of pedestrian overpasses, jumping in front of the public city trains, running into 80km/h traffic and all that until I reached a small corner in between two shops. I caught my breath for a bit and temporarily snapped back to sanity. Remembering what my counsellor told me, I pulled out my phone, called 911 and said I was trying to off myself.
The ambulance comes, a cop comes and I get whisked off to the hospital. I get put into a room, and in come these two women who I later learned were mental health workers. I told them my story, then they gave me a sandwich and put me into a room with a bed and told me to relax for a bit. And I did.
Until I found out that they called my dad, told him about the whole thing and that he was coming to see me.
You know that feeling you get in the pit of your stomach when you realize you've just made a huge mistake? I felt like that the entire wait for him.
When he showed up, he just seemed a)confused as hell about my suicidal stuff and b)happy that I was alive, breathing and in one piece.
So the workers show up, introduce themselves and then start explaining the whole thing. I sit beside them, nodding and occasionally adding things i saw necessary. It was all going good up until they told my dad about the whole apostasy thing.
Again, that feeling in the pit of your stomach? It was going into maximum overdrive or some shit in that moment. I honestly thought that i would get a stroke or something.
Right after being told, my dad looks like he just saw JFK getting shot or something. He asked them to repeat it, and they did.
At this point my dad's face went black. I asked him if he would accept it, and out came a stern ""No.""
I tried to convince him to accept my new faith, but now matter how hard I tried, it always boiled down to ""You're my son, but I will never accept this.""
So I lay down in the bed, just staring up at the roof while my dad gets my mum and my brother. Guess what mum said?
If you guess ""the exact same fucking thing"" then you're absolutely right. While i was in the bed, trying my hardest not to just sprint out of the hall and kill myself again, my parents said (and I quote) ""If you stay with this belief, you can't ever come home with us. You can just go rot on the streets."" And that's how that day went.
Cue the next morning, the workers come in and tell me that I'm being transferred to a psych ward in a hospital across the city. With this news, my parents seem to have completely changed their views, because they now said ""We support you. You're our eldest child and we want you to get better.""
So i get whisked off to the looney bin. All in all, it was a lot better than i expected. I made friends and actually felt a bit accepted for once, and to top it off i managed to see not one but two psychologists and a therapist. The main focus of the therapy during that week was CBT. It seemed useful enough, and the therapist suggested that i use it after i got released.
So about a week passes, i leave the hospital and then I'm dropped back into reality. For a week or two things started to seem to get better.
And then all that progress implodes. Now I use the CBT model not for therapy, but for self-hate. Yes, I actively find evidence to support the idea that I'm a worthless, unloved, waste of humanity. And the worst part? Evidence for that is surprisingly easy to find. I'm skinny and short (like i said, 104lbs and 64 inches is NEVER attractive) i'm a brown dude (which puts me at a disadvantage for employment, dating and pretty much everything) my mood swings way too severely and way too often and I'm so easily distracted that all of my goals, no matter how simple they are, go to waste. I'm seeing another therapist now, but i always switch back to the same self-hating, suicidal, insane fuck that i am. The therapist thinks it might me Anxiety, ADHD or both, but a diagnosis is pretty far away. And to top it all off, I am surrounded by people who are lightyears ahead of me in every way. I can't be proud of a 75% i worked my ass off for because they're complaining about their 88% and making me look like a fool. They all seem to get girlfriends and managed to get laid without even trying and I'm just stuck as a lonely virgin.  Despite the fact that I have never asked nor have i asked someone out (damn anxiety) I know inside that no one would want to date me, ever. I'm a tiny, self-hating sandnigger who no one can love truly. I'm an absolute waste of money, time and space. I have dreams (paramedicine, travelling the world) but like i said, i can't focus or concentrate to do the work needed in order to accomplish those goals. I know that i absolutely need to, but i always procrastinate and end up seeing myself for the idiot i am later on. Everything that could have counted for me as a ""good"" personality trait (sense of humour, willingness to explore, friendly) are all going down the shitter because of this. I've tried all the self help i could find; alpha-male bodybuilding stuff, self-acceptance, criticism of society but it just doesn't work.
And just today I managed to prove to myself some of the things mentioned above. With Valentine's day coming up, our school had the students fill out a questionnaire about themselves, and gave us the results back. I managed to somehow get matched with the most popular, attractive girls (high schools social groups are complete horseshit but it seems to be all that matters now). It's not like i'd ever have the confidence, looks or personality for them, so i just shrugged it off and went to my classes. In one, a girl that i actually am kind of interested in show me her matchmaking test, and I was her #1 pick. Being the awkward anxious fuck that i am, I simply said ""that's nice"" and spent the rest of the day trying to get the balls to ask her out. I didn't, so this serves as a reminder of how inept i am when it comes to this shit. I had a chance wide open for me and i fucking blew it.
And i hear all the time from people ""there's no rush to have sex! the media is bullshitting you!"" and ""short guys/skinny guys can get love!"" and also ""you shouldn't base your life on pop culture"" but what other choice do i have? This society is dominated by pop culture. If people won't consciouly admit it, it still manipulates their subconscious. I think that due to this, any advice that says ""fuck society! do your own thing"" is bs, because you can't fight something that huge. It's like a mosquito trying to take down a Boeing, it just won't work.
So there you have it. This is the story of the last two months for me, and how it brought me to see myself for the pathetic, virgin, unloved, short, criminally underweight, self-hating, suicidal, unfocused, anxious, worthless,socially disabled good-for-nothing person that I am.

I'm not sure if I care if anyone reads this. I just needed to vent, and didn't want to burden my boyfriend (hello, Ian, if you're reading this). Hey look! I care about something. That's a plus.

I can now look at peoples faces know the exact changes and operations that would have to be made to make them what society deems attractive. After all my studies I have learned that every single one of my facial features (save for my lips and ears) is a complete opposite of attractive. I lack bone structure and definition.

Big mistake, apparently.

I might actually have some form of chronic depression. I also might have been dealing with it since my teens and not realized I might have a mental health problem. I always thought I'm ""Said because: x and y"" but the more I start thinking about it, I'm sad because I just am. I'm sad because it appears to be a significant part of my personality. I use to think I was sad because I was very empathic with people. Humanity, struggling to find purpose and happiness. I just thought my view of the world was true, it was honest. Sadness and pain abound in the lives of anything human. 

While that may be true, I'm beginning to think something has corrupted my perception of the world and I hadn't realized it. That perhaps something was *wrong* with me. The last 12 months have been incredible difficult. They have certainly induced a level of anxiety and anger like never before. However, I'm not thinking they are the cause, but rather drawing from a well that has already been poisoned. 

I'm very introverted and I internalize everything and as such, I will brood over things. I can easily sleep anywhere from 9 to 12 hours a day. I find pleasure in nothing, but rather find ways to ""Escape"". My sex drive has completely tanked. It seems I go through months of this and then it will alleviate itself for a time but never really go away. I quite easily go from sad/calm to furious over things because my perception of life is that it is tiresomely difficult and obtuse as well as never changes and cannot change.

I was considering calling a doctor tomorrow to express these concerns.That perhaps seeking medical attention is the only way to make my misery more bearable. My concerns are this however.

It is such a significant part of my personality, that medications will fundamentally change who I am. While life is difficult, the few things that I feel make me valuable will be disabled. By that I mean my way with words, both spoken and written. I'm concerned they'll lose their depth.

The other issue is what kind of doctor do I see? Can going to an internal medicine doctor point me in the right direction?

I was diagnosed with severe depression when I was 15 and BPD last year, after several suicide attempts and self harm.
So there's a party this saturday where my friends from  university are attending (we're all bachelors by now)


I (25) haven't seen these people since september last year, I've become a shut in after some incident that happened when a male friend who fucked me over (male 30) and a female friend (29) who betrayed me and is now dating him. Tl;dr I went out with him, he was a douche who criticized everything I did, I have low self esteem so I tried to impress him, I told my female former friend about the whole thing, she used the info I gave her to get close to him, she simultaneously shit talked him and fucked him,both of them are now dating. Both of them were probably laughing at me the whole moment. 

By now I don't really care about either of them and can afford to see them in a party without feeling bad about myself. It took a lot to get over it, not over him, but over her betrayal.

Anyway the guy who's hosting the party lives really far from most of us, so we have to gather in groups if we wanna get there safely without getting lost. I asked a friend (f) if I could go with her but she refused because the ex- friend who betrayed me is going with her and she doesn't want HER to be uncomfortable.


I was shocked, this whole situation is really childish to be honest but having my group of friends act weird around me because, the guy in question is the ''leader'' guy in *motherfucking dota* to these guys and a closest friend that I am, because I'm a woman and they don't believe in ''being too close with a woman without any romantic interest''. And on the other hand, the girls are either neutral or siding with her, and it pisses me off. I can't believe how unfair life has been with me so far. I'm an introvert and like to be alone but I can't begin to explain how much it sucks to have been a social reject for your whole life and how this petty situation pales in comparison to the bullying and harassment I got during my childhood and teenage years.

My memories are coming back to me again. And I won't even begin to talk about my biological father..

I hate these people right now, I've really tried to be friendly to stop being so bitter, but I can't. I wish I could fly away and pretend they never existed. I'm thinking of applying to a university (WSU) and get the hell out of here (Peru) because *surprise* I'm not content with my current degree in communications either (in fact I hate it)

I'd go as far as to say I have one true real life friend in the whole world and then the friends I made on the internet.

Should I start by deleting these people from Facebook and avoid any contact with them? Or is it just me being too angry again?

Edit: If it wasnt clear enough, I'm not asking my ''friends'' to hate those two. I just hate how they're leaving me out because of them",BPD,t5_2qqdp,I am so angry right now it's getting hard to breathe

First, it's important to know that I have something that a lot of people my age don't have-- tons of freedom and the privilege of doing whatever I want for most of my day on a regular basis. Yay! Sounds awesome, right?

Let's sprinkle a little severe depression on top of that, with a side of anxiety and the untimely deaths of those closest to you, and then see how awesome it is.

* See how awesome it is to go get a pizza and have it made slightly differently than you wanted. **Depressed.**

* Have a really bad itch for no reason. **Depressed.**

* Cat doesn't want to play with you. **Depressed.**

* Find out you missed a sale on something you wanted to buy. **Depressed.**

* Computer crashes while you were typing something that's not even really important, and it didn't save. **DE-FUCKIN-PRESSED.**

There is absolutely nothing I can do with my free time, other than lay in the dark doing nothing, that doesn't have the (very high) potential to completely fuck up my day, or sometimes my week.

I find that people tend to judge in this situation, because it's difficult to handle responsibilities when a person goes through this (if things I *like* to do cause me pain, why would I even take a chance on things I *don't* want to do?). It seems quite easy to judge when you're not someone who's constantly surrounded by psychological landmines, even in places that I'd consider ""safe"" or ""comforting."" 

Now if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go cry myself to sleep and do my best to make sure this doesn't turn into a suicide note.

**EDIT:** Well, that didn't help at all. I have no idea what to do. Not a clue. Everything I do could possibly, and easily, blow up in my face and ravage me psychologically (and this includes anything I'd do to try to *improve* my mood).

Looks like me and the emptiness of oblivion are gonna get to know each other real well. Here's to spending the majority of whatever's left of my life doing absolutely nothing just to keep from having a massive panic attack on a regular basis.

I'm so fucking lonely. All the time. 

And yet I'm not alone. People like me. I think. I'm jolly. I have an infectious smile. Or so I'm told.

But I feel so alone. What the fuck?

And right now I'm the least alone I've ever been. I've just started a full time acting course that last for three years. I have fifteen class mates, and they're all lovely. Utterly lovely. I'm with them for nine hours every day. 

And yet I see the way they interact with each other. The way they connect. Almost effortlessly. And I want that. I want to be a part of that. And I think I am, but I don't feel like it. I feel like they've all formed these amazing friendships already and I'm on the outside of it all. I'm the classmate that they put up with. Balls.

I feel so alone. And ashamed. When someone asks me a question I often make something up to seem less... pathetic, I suppose. If asked how I'm getting home from a party I say my mum was in the area already so she's picking me up from the party instead of my mum had to drive from home to pick me up because I can't drive. I'll make up things that I'm doing on the weekend so people don't know I'm sitting at home. 

I've never been in a relationship. I've never kissed anyone for real, apart from on stage. It's hardly surprising, really. I'm a fat guy. I'm becoming less fat, with effort, but I'm still a fat guy. I don't want to sound like one of those whiny twelve year olds, and of course that's not the be all and end all. But it's still a thing. Oh well. I'll develop a crush on someone so easily. Like, it can happen within days of talking to them. Something about a girl with a nice smile and who seems to be genuinely kind and together and warm just attracts me like a moth to a flame. Trouble is, a girl like that is absolutely not going to be interested in a guy like me. But that's besides the point really.

Last night we had a sick-ass party. It was a good time. For them, at least. I managed to enjoy myself at times. A lot of them got very drunk, which was hilarious. I don't drink, although I wish I did. I wouldn't know where to start, though. And I'm afraid that instead of making me more fun getting drunk would just strip away the facade I maintain and reveal the deeply sad, broken little boy inside. One girl (probably the person I'm closest to in the class) is a very touchy feely drunk and said some very nice things and stroked my hair. Which was nice. And some of the people in the years above us who were hosting the party were genuinely awesome. I'm surrounded by fantastic people. 

So why the fuck do I feel so alone?

God damn it. 

I often feel like an observer. Almost like an anthropologist. I watch these people interact. Sometimes I participate. But it's not the same. I don't have that level of closeness. And I want it so bad. I really do. Sometimes I can barely fucking deal with this feeling.

I think I just want someone to talk to.

While in the hospital I was taken off the fluoxetine and put on 150mg of venlafaxine. I took that from December 2012 until October 2014. To make a long story short I couldn't afford it anymore and had to stop. Meanwhile I still have a prescription for fluoxetine, which I can afford, and took it for about a week in October to deal with the venlafaxine withdrawals. I haven't taken it since.

My question is: should I resume the fluoxetine? The prescription I have is for 20mg. I didn't like being a slave to Big Pharma, and I didn't like being under the oppressive yoke of venlafaxine. Miss one dose, even by just a matter of hours, and the withdrawals/brain zaps start.

I work at Walmart and everyday I'm there, I want to kill myself. I have a BA (albeit in a useless major), but I work as a cashier.

I don't make enough to move out, so I'm stuck living at home.

At least if I didn't have a job, I'd have all the time in the world to find a decent one that pays well and to work on my hard skills (programming and putting my code up on GitHub), but because I'm working, my time is limited and I can't apply to as many jobs as I would like. 

And I know that having a gap on your resume is bad, but I think working at a minimum wage job for so long when you have a degree can look bad too. 

I'm treated like crap on a daily basis, and this in turn effects my self esteem and confidence. It doesn't help that I look young for my age (I'm 26). Everyone treats me like a dumb teenager, despite the fact that I'm a college educated adult. 

I have needs and wants that I want to fulfill, but never can because this job doesn't afford me to, and no one wants to hire me. I want/need:

* Friends

* To get laid (still a virgin)

* To get proper therapy

* To move out

* To join a gym

* To get a livable wage

* To move to a big city

I was going to teach English in Japan (and if you insist that I should, **FUCK OFF**. And also, **I've lived in Japan before**), but I can't meet many of the needs above if I do. I know if I go, my speaking will improve, but making friends where I am now is hard enough; Japanese people aren't exactly the most open. 

Getting laid might be the easiest on my list, but it still could be a problem. Being in a small town, girls might not be as open about being with a foreigner. Even if they do, remember, Japanese people aren't exactly the most open. 

Therapy will be out of the question. Even if I get past the language barrier, Japan doesn't have a high regard for mental health. I know that I absolutely need to see a therapist. 

Moving out is the only thing on this list that will 100% happen if I go to Japan. 

I also want to get back into working out, but Japanese people aren't too big with lifting. Especially since I'll be in a small town, finding a proper gym may be impossible.

I also won't be making a good wage and might be trapped in the country (my employer even said they won't provide a ticket when I complete my contract).

Finally, I want to live in a big city, but I'll be living in a small town with no nightlife or foreign community.

I would like to live in Japan again, but my life is in such shambles that I think it would cause more problems. And if i decide not to go, it could affect my future employment options in the country.

Worst part is, I leave next month, so I won't be able to solve half of this. 

But of course, if I don't go, I'll be stuck working my dead end job with little opportunities to work anywhere else.",depression,t5_2qqqf,Being underemployed is worse than being unemployed

First, I suffer with depression for many years. I dont think it was an event that caused my depression rather than my personality as I am socially awkward since my childhood. If anything else is my whole childhood to be blamed, I think.

Anyways, tonight I downloaded and watched the last two HarryPotter films. The deathly hallow 1 and 2.

They were awesome, however at the end of it, depression kicked it.

In the last scene, the old Harry, Ron and Hermione took their children to railway station. Their children had to carry all of their staff in suitcases and an animal in a cage. Like it was when Harry was going to Hogwards for the first time.

I dont know what there is in that scene but it makes me feel my life is boring. It has no interest... it has no magic.

I do not really want magic as in movies but I want to live an adventure. Right now I am stuck in a situation where I do the same thing every day. On the other hand I would not like to travel to another country, it is not that type of adventure I seek. In fact it is really hard for me to understand what I want.

Even after I re read what I just wrote it simply doesnt express how I actually feel. I dont know what there was in that scene but it made me feel warm. Is it because some old kind friends meet? is it because they have their own families? I certainly wouldnt like a family either. Is it the way their lives seem in the move?

Does anyone ever feel like they want something but dont know what it is ? well thats how I feel and it sucks.

I seem to be having a hard time pouring this out to anyone so I thought I'd just leave it here. I feel that talking to someone about this would only be taking up their time. At least this way, anyone can stop by at their convenience.

I've made a few friends at work but for some reason there are just those who get to know you but after a while when you see them again they give you this vibe that they don't want to be around you. I don't get it. When I got hired for work we came in batches, so I was looking forward to a great friendship with these guys. It was not surprising it didn't turn out that way. It was like college all over again. I can't tell what about me turned them off. I cracked a few jokes and they laughed, I conversed with them occasionally and I haven't wronged anyone. Maybe I became detached from their circle of friends because of refusing their invitations to go out drinking (I'm not a drinker). Not so sure what ticked them about me. There is this one person from day one who was usually friendly to other people but when it came to me she's just cold. The jokes I cracked made everyone laugh except for her. A year has passed now and they're close a pretty tight crew by now.

Not that I have given up. I found a friend in a supervisor at the workplace. I thought it was all good, but ever since he moved to another account, he's been giving me the cold shoulder. I'm pretty sure I haven't done anything wrong.

Sometimes I start to think that it's because of how I look. Maybe I have a face that people want to slug. It's weird because I am a friendly guy but I guess I lack charm or something. I exert as much effort as anyone to make friends but it just doesn't seem to work.

At times, it leaves me wondering but I try hard not to think too much of it. Still, it would be great to make a lasting friendship at work. It would really help with dealing stress :)

Let me elaborate. I have roommates that I don't know all that well, and one (if not more) is always camped out in the livingroom adjacent to the front door. To enter the house completely you have to pass this stretch of couches (that happen to face passers-by directly/head-on).

I get nervous about coming home because I know I'll panic and ignore those in the room entirely, scurrying to my safe bedroom. Pretending not to notice an entire room. The charade seems uncomfortable for both parties. 

However, it also seems uncomfortable to greet them. Will I be pulled into conversation and immediately made antsy to retreat to my bedroom? Will I stand there for a few moments expecting more of a response when there won't be one? Is it more awkward than ignoring them, as clearly I'm not the sort of person to say ""hello"" and welcome conversation upon arriving home?

I don't know how to mediate this anxiety, because if I start greeting my roommates suddenly I'll feel obligated to always, religiously do it. Needing to do so will ramp up the nerve waves. But as things are I come off as completely unapproachable.

And for a good reason.

I am a horrible person. I fucking hate myself. I don't know what it's with me, but I'm a fucking horrible person and I deserve to die. I have no place on this planet, in this time. The world has no use for me. I have no family, career choices, or romantic interests, so what's the point of still being here? Why do I even wake up in the morning? Why? Why don't I just kill myself right now and get it over with?

Fuck the afterlife. God and Devil alike can go stick themselves up imagination's ass. I don't want to go to an afterlife. Fuck religion. I want to stop existing. Before I was born, I didn't exist --- I couldn't feel anything. I want to feel that again. I want to stop existing. I don't want life after death. I don't want to live. I don't want to be here. I don't want to feel worthless and not have a purpose.

But of course I have to feel worthless and like I don't have a purpose, because I DON'T! I'm worthless and I know that.
I'm complicated. I don't want attention but get mad when I don't get any. I'm sad and want someone to be there for me but get mad and curse and yell at them when they finally show up. I want to be comforted but I don't accept words of comfort. It's no puzzle why no one likes me. It's no puzzle why I don't even like myself.
My worst fear is that my small group of friends secretly hate me and don't want me. It's evident already. Afterschool, I'm never invited to any hangouts. They never talk to me. They never value my opinions. Are they even my friends? I'm an outcast and that's obvious. People talk behind my back, and I know that for a fact, because rooms go silent the moment I walk in.

I hear gossip be passed across hallways every day. I hear gossip and rumors about me, being talked behind my back to my face.
I hate myself. I hate thinking. If I were given the choice between either increasing or decreasing my IQ by 100, I would choose to decrease. Maybe if I live in my own beautiful grey twilight where I know neither happiness nor pain, but rather a maroon constant titillation for the rest of my life, maybe then I'd be happy. Maybe then I'd stop overthinking. Maybe then I'd stop having trust issues. Now that I mention it, I want to start ranting about trust. I trust no one. My friends lie to me, and speak behind my back. It is evident why I would not be able to trust. But more than that, I can't trust myself. I can't stop overthinking. I can't stop questioning one's motives. I can't stop wondering if deep inside, everyone has the silent intent to punch me in the face. I know many do, and many are people I thought I could have trusted.
I hate it when people get competitive, yet I am competitive myself. I am a hypocrite. An eye for an eye makes the whole worlds blind --- well then perhaps I am already blind! Perhaps I am blind of the undetected genuine motives of people.
I feel like I'm being used every day. I feel like people only want me to help them with their homework, and then they throw me in the gutter. I feel like I'm never appreciated.

Again, I'm complicated. I don't want whoever reads this to feel sad for me, yet I want to, but I won't believe anything you say. I don't know what to do. I'm confused the naked, cold, ugly truth of a world.

I don't know anymore. What even makes waking up worth it?

Maybe one day I’ll muster up the courage to finally let the noose pull back and squeeze on my throat, blocking the airways as I finally let a genuine smile escape.

Maybe one day I’ll muster up the courage to finally swallow all of my anti depressants at once.

Maybe one day I’ll muster up the courage to jump.

Maybe one day I’ll muster up the most courage to get help.

My delve into depression, my plunge into ponderance, my mirage of madness.

Don’t matter.

It’s never mattered. Nothing about me has ever mattered. Why do I even bother to awake in the morning? Why do I even try? It’s not worth it, I keep telling myself, but no matter how hard I try to smile, to have a friendly conversation, to attempt to conform, I can’t escape this dark black void inside of me.

I can’t escape him. He’s everywhere. He’s a horrible man who wears a smile for a mask. I can’t escape him because he’s inside of me. He is me.

I can’t escape it. I can’t. I have no power. I’ve never had power. I’ve never had any control over anything in my life. I experience sorrow and pain and woe every day but it is almost invisible behind such a mask of delight and joy.

People keep saying that maybe if you wear this mask of delight and joy every day, the mask will grow on you and become a part of you. Well why has it never worked for me? Why? Is it because I am undesirable? My being? Why? Why does it have to be me?

All I want to have is a friend who will be there and care for me until the end. Why does the bad man have more respect than I, someone who has never had any in my life. Why does it have to be me? Why did I have to be born? What kind of a fucked up God would curse the world with my presence, with my ugly face or my destroyed voice? What kind of a fucked up God would breathe life into me? What kind of a fucked up God would make me be me?

There is no God. There is no hope. There is no life.

One day I will end it. One day. Maybe it will be tomorrow, maybe not. Maybe it will be in three years when no change has occurred. Not like change occurs anyways, not like I matter.

I want to cease from existing. I want to do the world a favor by removing myself.

No one knows me. I have no one. I have no one to talk to. I have no one to comfort me.

No one. Not even myself, for why would I speak with the man who hates me most?

Why do I have to exist? Why? Just let me die, for the love of Mankind, let me die, let me wither. And so what if it will be painful? It doesn’t matter.

I’ve never mattered.",depression,t5_2qqqf,I am a horrible person and I don't deserve to exist

Some as an attempt to be whatever those around me needed me to be, whether it be a foster family, an employer or people I was trying to fit in with/or not be trampled on by.

Over time I got better at making them, especially once I started working in tech/customer support where they pretty much teached  us a set of skills that help you read people and respond with the appropriate level of speech and manufactured emotion.

I built so many of them over time that sometimes I could hardly remember which one I was supposed to be wearing.

* The dutiful son.

* The reliable friend.

* The caring boyfriend

* The helpful employee

* The kind, encouraging voice that guides you to a solution to your tech issue.

and many many more.

of course the majority of them are flimsy and will start to crack  under too much pressure requiring that I spend time alone to mend them but for the most part I've been able to pretend I'm human for 36 years now. 

Over the past few years though I've started discarding some as I am just too exhausted to care. I cut off all contact with family, no more dutiful son same with ""friends"" gave up on the idea of relationships because I realized if it ever go to a serious point I'd never have any time to mend the mask.

Yesterday though a coworker pulled me into her office right after I came in because a software she uses wasn't loading. While I was fixing the issue she made a joke me probably finding her annoying  with all the problems she has. 

The mask cracked and I failed to respond appropriately at that point which made her pause for a moment before prodding about that in a more serious manner and for a brief moment the mask felt like it was on the verge of completely shattering. 

It was enough for real me to peek through long enough to give her an icy stare and blurt out ""I DON'T like people..."" though clenched teeth.

Suffice to say she was a bit flabbergasted and said ""So you don't like me?""

Took literally all the self control I had left to compose myself and say  ""I didn't mean it like that, I'm just not a people person."" then walk out.

I'm worried now, not only is this a bad omen If I can't keep it together for even 10 minutes but this is a pretty small office and the others are a pretty tight knit group so if she mentions it to someone I might have to explain my outburst and I'm not sure I'll be able to keep things together enough to not have another major crack and keep my job.

Words and woes to express the feelings that nobody really knows.




The demons, they're always in the background of my life, but they come out especially at night. I exorcise them with words, but they're here to stay.




My wretched creations, they tell me things, they tell me the only truth I ever see, that I ever believe. The value of my life is insignificant, with every failure being proof of this truth, and every success, a mere fluke.




To be wrong I'm happy, but to be right is never the correct answer, but it isn't wrong either. It has to be, it has to be, it has to be RIGHT. I stand before the court of myself, and my demons, they bring my life to testify, tell me what to remember, to close the case. I am judge, jury, executioner, and I am also the one on trial, already found guilty. I bring in one hand a glass half full, and in the other, a glass half empty. The glass half full evaporates, and the glass half empty grows heavier, until I drink my madness, the mercury inside.




I'll never be good enough, to accumulate enough meaningless value to have worth. Every day is a test with a problem laid out in front of my eyes. It asks, ""why are you so sad?"" And the only answer I have is that there is no reason, so it must be me. There's no such thing as demons, that I want to be sad. That my madness is my own fault. The demons are a part of me, they are me. There are no red tails or horns, I'm surrounded by mirrors, lost in a maze where every corner I turn I find myself glaring down at me. I hate him just as much as he hates me.




It's all my fault, it has to be. Taking the blame doesn't change the rules of the game, it remains ever the same. Bound in chains I can't cry, but in my soul and my brain it rains. The nights are cloudy and sad, as the logic clashes with the lies, but in the end I'm the only one that loses.




Regrets. Every day is never enough. I sit and rot as I watch the clock go by and I don't want to die, but when I ask myself why I want to live, I tell myself that lie. That I'm content in my own madness, and the lies keep me sane.




There is one more lie, did you catch it? It's been in the back of your mind for quite some time, so look back to that first line. ""Poetry"". I don't know poetry, I never have. This is my debut, without rhymes, and without reason. My madness on paper. My first poem.

It's made me feel like a real person for the first time in my adult life. 

But now I'm having neurological problems..dizziness, weakness, vision changes. It could be caused by my antipsychotic, so the doc says I have to spend a week off my meds and see if the issues go away. 

My mood started crashing on Sunday. All the negative self-talk is coming back. I'm frustrated with my projects, I'm lonely at work, and I feel like a failure. Knowing that none of it is true and it'll all be better soon doesn't help. 

I'm keeping myself sedated on anxiety meds and just trying to stay distracted. All I'm expecting myself to do is go to work and come home. I'm staying away from my friends because I don't want them to see me like this. My husband is my rock. 

Even though the depression isn't as bad as it was before, it feels worse, because I got a taste of being normal. I'm terrified that the antipsychotic caused the neuro problems and I won't be allowed to take it anymore. It's the only thing that's ever made me feel okay.

At the time, I've finally reached to the point that I couldn't keep myself together. I was in bad shape, the prolonged sad feeling wouldn't go away, the suicidal thoughts wouldn't shut up with struggles of self harm. Therefore, I admitted myself to the ER and then I got transferred to a stabilization unit/residential hospital, where I stayed there for about a week. From there I've received my diagnosis with severe MDD and been put on medication with effexor. 

Now fast forward to now. Since my discharge from inpatient,  I've been going to outpatient services, which I've already been to two therapy sessions, and will soon follow up next week with my psychiatrist about my medication, then after another week,  my third therapy session.

 Honestly, I feel a lot more tired with this medication, and I find myself calm at times. Suicidal thinking still lingers from time to time but it has lessen a great deal, and I sleep a whole lot more. However, I'd still be feeling at my worst. I'd be in bed wide awake at 3am: ""I don't want to do anything. I don't want to know anything. I don't want to see anybody. I don't want to speak to anyone. Please please please leave me alone please. I'm stupid, useless and I'm worthless.""
So as far as I'm concerned, therapy is still going great, but I realized I have a lot of fixing to do and it's going to take a long while til I get there. 

Concern #1: But this medicine is what gets me insecure, how long does it take for that stuff to start working? Or would I end up having to switch for a different pill? 

& I don't know if the following information can make any justice but here it goes: I am a 21 yr old female college student,  studying for psychology. I have no job, can't legally drive yet (for fear that I can simply drive off and it could be the last time anybody would have seen me alive). I've struggled with this awful sadness since I was 12 but it comes and goes with or without self harm and/or eating disorders and suddenly it's just here to stay, just sadness with self harm to cope with it all. In all means, this psychiatric encounter is the first time I ever been evaluated by a psychiatrist and receive diagnosis and treatment for it. It took a long 9 years to carry this burden and I'm finally going to address the issue. So yeah,  the struggle is real for the most part. Apart from that, I am a busy bee, always wanting to handle everything,  and highly involved with activities on campus, church and whatnot. 

If applicable to anyone who can give me advice for this one,  it's understandable if y'all can't answer:
Concern #2: I have reached out to many types of people about this. Some people shy away or simply say,  don't over think things,it's a waste of time, or the infamous: ""what do you have to be sad about? you are lucky to go to college and have an easier life than mom and dad back in their days at their home country."" And then there's these people, don't get me wrong,  I love them so much and I do think of similar values that a Christian would want in their life but whenever I go to them (any of the trusted adult members) about this painful struggle,
 I get lectured about how ""I need to pray more or harder and put all your troubles on God and He will listen"". I do believe in all of those things but, it was basically a ""been there done that, what part do any of y'all don't understand?! I need help!! "". So yeah,  this is all confusing to me.
