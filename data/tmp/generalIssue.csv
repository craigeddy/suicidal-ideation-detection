I've been losing my temper over little things and often find myself having quite dark thoughts. I will imagine the person (real or not) often being tortured, mutilated, humliated, etc. That I am in control of the situation and I want to hurt them, repeatedly. Various methods are imagined in this process and I even come up with my own at times. (Imagining myself killing their entire family in front of them). Now I know 100% that I would never attempt to do anything of the sorts. I could never bring myself to do it nor live with myself after the fact. But is it bad of me to indulge in these thoughts and even... take satisfaction at the idea of someone who's wronged me to pay dearly?

I have a craving fueled diet, consisting of diet soda and just whatever I want to eat. There is no regulation. I was exercising regularly but that went down the toilet, although I guess I am not as inactive as I could be. 

I spend hours and hours a day on the computer and playing video games. My sleep schedule is bonkers, some days I will sleep 12 hours and some 4. Sometimes I will be up all night and then all day and sometimes I go to bed at a regular time (12am or something to that effect). 

I have noticed I am really anxious and kinda depressed lately, I am pretty sure its because of all this. I really should kick myself and get more disciplined and into a routine. I am 6ft and about 160 pounds, I just dont really gain weight. I have noticed that a lot of people live like this, glued to a computer for most of their off time and just in a lifestyle of eating shitty and sleeping shitty. I ask myself if this trend is why people are generally anxious and depressed, most of the people I interact with say they struggle with at least some form of anxiety and/or depression.


People are spending more and more time indoors glued to monitors, eating sugar and fat laden diets. Are we as a society just prone to this because of the lifestyle our habits have cultivated over the past 30-50 years or so? I read a study that said by 2050 the majority of people will be myopic (nearsighted) because of how long we spend on electronic devices. 

I mean we have a culture of crash and burn, consume caffeine like a mad dog, work your ass off every breath, 5 hours a night is fine, take a xanax for your anxiety. Ugh, it is all too much. I mean I guess my question is, excluding genetic mental disorders, are we all just melting our brains with our crappy ass lifestyles? Is the uptick in depression and anxiety to do with how we live?

For the past few years something changed in my head. I went from an arrogant, over confident person to the most quiet and alienated person I ever saw. 
I can´t talk to anyone. I CAN NOT approach someone first. When someone talks to me I answer, but I can see that my answers just kind of push people away. I tend to agree with everything and add nothing new to the little conversation that is every conversation i have. 
I came to enjoy the loneliness but loneliness is not the reason that brought me here.
Some might say these are depression/anxiety symptoms, but the truth is that this I explained above is the only problem I have that fit the usuall symptoms(and lost of interest in some before loved activities maybe). I don´t have any problem with being in a crowded place, make presentations in front of several students (as long as I have the presentation memorized), never had any suicidal thought or any physical pain without a reason. 
Could this be something else not mental related?! Please give me your opinion. Maybe here I´ll find a way to make this make sense.

I'm no writer of any sort (obviously) so apologies if the grammar is not 100%. With that out the way, I started this just for myself with no intention other than to be a coping mechanism. However, further down the line I started to realise that this could potentially help other people who go through the same difficulties on a daily basis and most importantly, could raise a huge awareness upon mental illness. Evidently, mental illnesses are not often talked about, but often brushed under the carpet and almost frowned upon. Because of this, this creates a humongous amount of stigma attached to this topic which can result in a person feeling even more embarrassed or ashamed; which of course they should never be made to feel. I hope this gives you an insight into what it's like living with a mental illness on a daily basis, hope you enjoy the read!

“It's exhausting having to fight a war inside of your head.”
Imagine this. Your heart is racing at what feels like two thousand beats per minute. Both fists clenched into a tight, tight ball. Sweating, from every existing gland in your body. Palms so wet whilst instantaneously losing grip of everything you touch. Confusion, nothing makes sense as thoughts are rushing around in your head from every direction, disturbing your vision as you do everything in your power to see straight. A tight ball like feeling in your throat, so tight that you cannot breath. It’s the feeling you experience when the edge of a crisp gets stuck in your throat, slowly and painfully cutting your glands. A sick like feeling, wanting to let it go but doing what you can to keep it back. Don’t embarrass yourself like this, not if people are watching. Now onto the chest. Feeling so tight and heavy as if someone is standing on top of you, crushing you with every power and strength within them, whilst you pant and gasp for air and catch each and every breath that your body allows you to. Shaking, crying, sweating, tensing, shivering, trembling. And now slowly breathe with every bit of energy that is left in you. You are fine, you are alive and it’s over for now. 

The brain is a complex thing, just as complex as ones human mentality. The limbic system controls emotions within the human brain, there's no surprise that at the best of times you feel as if you have a complete lack of control over your emotional and mental state. The brain is so incredibly complex that it often even puzzles scientists; the same people who allowed the first human beings into space and onto the moon. The same people who are able to clone living and breathing animals, create satellites for outer space, discover electricity, gravity, evolution, DNA. And yet, they fail to completely understand the human brain and each function that is involved and why they are involved. Many people fail to realise that not everyone thinks in the same way, not one person has the same thought process as another human being walking this earth. What may seem logical and rational to one human being may seem completely and utterly bizarre to another. 

There is a fine line between feeling lonely and being alone. In the depths of the night when the sun has set and there is nothing to see in the deep sky apart from the twinkling of the bright stars. Hearing the occasional sound of a car passing by, the tree leaves lightly tap-taping against the window due to the slight breeze in the dead of night. The sirens that wake the streets; whilst people question if a life has just been taken from us, or is it that a life is about to enter our world of mystery? At night, when people lay asleep with their heads softly against their pillow, you lay there gazing at the ceiling, unable to sleep, wondering to yourself what you could have done differently that day. Sleep. 7 to 8 hours of sleep they say. But what if you can't sleep due to the constant thoughts and feelings rushing through your head from that day, from weeks, months, even years ago. The mind is a dangerous place, a place that I fear as I know it is stronger and more powerful than I am. Have you ever been surrounded my so many people, so many bodies, but felt so lost. Helpless. Alone. Questioning how the silence can be so loud. Lost in thought, whilst hearing the mummers of those surrounding you. 

Imagine feeling a prisoner of your own body. The only body you will have for as long as you may live. The body that will grow and cherish into something beautiful at adolescence. The body that will make love to another body, feeling each and every edge and crevice. The body that will see into the eyes of their loved one, touch their hand, smell their recognisable scent, one that comforts them with ease. The body that will taste their sweet lips and the body that will hear their touching and soothing voice gently in their ear. The human body is a remarkable thing, each and every one unique and different in every way, shape and form. But what happens when you start to lose control of your body, the one body that is yours and no one else's. When your bones feel weak and your limbs like jelly. Like you're floating on a cloud, uncertain about those sweet lips you once kissed, those gentle voices you once heard, the feel and warmth of the person you love turn to cold, the smell no longer there and their eyes unfamiliar with fear. You start to lose everything you once remembered, everything you once cared for and everything that your body allowed you to do. Eventually, they all just become distant memories. All the people you have met become lost faces. 

Time. Time is inevitable. Too little time, or too much time? Should you be too early, or just on time? Time is a concept made up by human beings. The sun rising suggests it is morning time, the sun setting however, you guessed, implies that the day is coming to a close and all is left is the dark night's sky. What if there were no such thing as time? Would people be less stressed, less rushed, less busy? What would people do to insure they are being kept occupied? How would the world go on? When you become lonely, sad, anxious, depressed; time works in two of which ways. Time either stands still or in contrast, goes as fast as lightning and by the time you know it, you lose track of where you are, what you have done, even who you are. On average, it takes a human being 2o muscles to smile and 50 muscles to frown. Yet, why are there so many people spending their days crying, worrying, distressed surrounding themselves in pity and self doubt. If it takes such little muscles to create a smile, how does it become so hard for someone to put one together. Their smile may be imperfect, broken or even jiggered, but it is still a smile that may bring delight into someone's bleak day. A smile has the power to touch someone's heart, touch someone's soul. Imagine, for whatever reason you felt as if you could no longer smile without it feeling fake, like a scam. Seeing another smile, a smile of a friend, a loved one, even a stranger; can bring you so much joy and happiness to someone.

Breathing. An essential, necessary part of life. Any life. We all breath, if it wasn't for our power to breath none of us would be here, would exist, the world would be an empty, lonely shell. But what if with every breath you take, your lungs feel like they are filled with water. Like someone is crushing your windpipe, struggling to breath without the aid of another existence. Each breath getting slower, harder, faster, slower, faster, harder. Until you can no longer take it anymore. Until you collapse in a ball, questioning the why's and the what's and the who's. Whoever put me on this earth, whatever is out there, why me? To breath like another human being, that's all that I ask of you. 

Excuses, excuses, excuses. I can't say I'm anxious, I already said that last week, and the week before, and probably the week before that too. I'll say that I'm ill, yes, just ill. No questions asked, just ill. That way, I won't look lazy to them. I won't have to explain myself, why I'm feeling this way. The reality is, I don't even know myself. How do you explain that to someone when you can't get the right words out? When nothing you say will make sense, when you don't know why you're up and you're down, all day every day. How do you explain that to someone on the outside? That it's a constant cycle of emotions. That, however much you try you cannot leave your bed. That each step you take that day, all you are looking forward to is returning to your room, surrounded by darkness and crawling back into bed. Sleeping. Your safe place, where no one can disturb you, not even the cars outside, the voices echoing the streets, the sound of the metro line, Because you are alone with your thoughts in the darkness, until you slowly drift off into a long sleep. Too little sleep or not enough, there is no in between and no matter what, tiredness always wins. It defeats you, laughs at you and mocks you. Tiredness is a silent killer. It waits until you are energised, finally feeling happy until it creeps out on you from nowhere, like burred treasure among the sands over the blue, clear waters. 

Panic. What do I do with my day? Slowly awaken, shower to wake up the mind, the body the soul. Get ready and feeling good, quick look in the mirror, today could be a good day. Ready. Panic. What do I do now? When was the last time I ate? Am I eating because I'm hungry, or because I know it's the right thing to do? Because my body needs the nutrients in order to survive. Baby steps. No more routines, I'm free to the world but the freedom is almost suffocating. Procrastinate. Endless hours upon hours doing nothing but everything, trying to eat, trying to breath, trying to be normal. The skies are getting dark and the streets are becoming quieter. Time to sleep, my favourite part. Dreams, dreams about love, romance, the best days of your life so far. Woken up suddenly with what feels like a tonne of bricks hitting against your forehead. Awaken, get ready, repeat. 

Coldness. It creeps up on you, sending tingles and shivers all throughout your body. From your neck down to the depths of your spine, through your legs, your arms, to the tips of your fingers and your toes until you slowly start to feel like a stray dog, left all alone on a cold winter’s night. No owner, no food, no home, nothing. You are left feeling like nothing, invisible. Invisible to yourself, your neighbours, your friends. Would anyone notice if I were to go? Leave this place, this town, this city, this world and never look back? Who would miss me? No. That isn't me talking, I am fine. I am no longer in control of my emotions; I have been taken over by a rush of coldness and hotness all at one. Confusion. Why is it so hard to think straight, to see straight, to be normal. What is normal, if there is such thing?

“Patience is a virtue”, one of my favourite sayings. To have patience with someone shows that you care. You are passionate about what they have to say. Their thoughts, feelings, emotions, ideas, philosophies. It puts things into perspective, indulges you with new knowledge and education. Feeds your brain in more ways than you realise. You almost start to care more about their ideas than your own, as you analyse in explicit detail their body language, every hand gesture, movement. You start to become at one with them. But what if, however, you have an astounding amount of patience with these people, but not with yourself. Not with your emotions, your feelings, your thoughts, even your movements. You brush them under the carpet, pretend they're not there. I mean, they're not visible to the naked eye, so no one would notice otherwise. Right? Wrong. Emotions matter, feelings matter. However big, small, funny, comical. We are human beings and as human beings, we must come together. But what do you do when you no longer recognise yourself? The person standing in front of the mirror, that isn't the same person from a few weeks, months, years ago. That smile. That smile that once lit the room has been replaced with something bleak. I wouldn't call it a smile, just a crook of the face. Those eyes. Those eyes that were once filled with joy, now filled with emptiness and water from the never ending tears that are wept throughout the night. Those hands. Those hands that would be used to ride a bike for the first time, draw, paint, now tremble at the whirlwind of thoughts, sweat among the constant pit of sorrow and anxiety and continue to tremble. What happened to her? The twinkle in her eye has disappeared. She looks sad, bewildered, as she looks out into the huge, never-ending world before her.

I couldn't face people today, what if I mess up? What if I embarrass myself? But why should I care, they are strangers who I will most likely never see again. Oh, but what if I do? Would they remember, would they care? Thoughts spinning round in my head. It's wanting to go out, but not wanting to socialise. Wanting to be successful, but being afraid of failure. Wanting long lasting relationships, but not wanting to show people your real self, your self-pity, self-loathing, sad self. It's wanting to eat, but not physically being able to. It's waning to go for a walk, a run, but not having the energy to. It's wanting to go to a party, wanting to get dressed up, but not wanting to make small talk with people, strangers. It's wanting to be productive, but not wanting to get up on a morning. It's wanting to sleep, wanting to shut down, but finding every distraction you can to stop yourself. It's wanting to be happy, but spoiling it for yourself, knowing it won't last for long as the next thing is always around the corner. The next headache, the next bad news, the next anything. It's wanting to be surrounded by people, familiar, comforting faces and places, but wanting nothing but to isolate yourself from the world, alone in your room. It's wanting to travel somewhere new, but not wanting to risk it in case you feel trapped with nowhere to run, no way to get home, no way to get back to your safe haven. It's finding excuses not to do things, not to go places, not to travel, see the world surrounding us. It's finding it easier talking online, through text, as it is in real life. It's feeling not lonely, but alone, with no way to escape the epitome of darkness.

It’s an indescribable feeling. A feeling that doesn’t quite go, doesn’t leave your body and is somehow, always there. A feeling I wouldn’t wish upon anyone, not even the most extreme prisoners. I bet they feel alone, too. Not just a prisoner literally, but mentally. Wishing they could turn back time and be surrounded by friends, family and those closest to them. Instead, they are surrounded by the heavy metal bars that keep them away from society, isolated with only their thoughts. Being a prisoner of your own mind is a dangerous thing. It’s always far easier to just tell people “I’m tired” when they ask how you are, how you are feeling. Because it’s the truth. Physically, mentally and emotionally exhausted. It drains the life from your bones, the happiness from your blood and the soul from your veins. You no longer feel human, like a living and breathing being. You just exist, you are just there. 

Wouldn't it be nice to be young again. To be care free, innocent, knowing nothing but happiness and peace in the world. Cherishing every joyous memory with friends, staying up late watching cartoons. Having no worries, no cares in the world. The only problems we faced were those of the anticipating moments, wondering if we would get our first detention for handing in late homework, or forgetting to underline the date and the title. Oh how clumsy of us! Going home from school wondering if today was the day that the boy from school finally noticed you. Unaware of the evil out there. The violence, the war. The people that were once here, once had families, but lost their battle and couldn't find the light at the end of the darkness. The racism, the religious slurs that leave the mouths of the uneducated, the ignorant. These same mouths that start their day sipping on Chinese tea, getting ready as they put on their Indian shirt and Thai, suede shoes. Wrapping their Swiss watch around their wrist, as time for him is money. Leaving the day behind drinking their Russian vodka, French wine, German beer. Oh the irony. I didn't know about mental illness until twelve years old. Experienced my first panic attack at fourteen years old. Understandably, assuming I was having a fit, heaving a heart attack, dying. What was happening to my body? To my emotions? So powerful and overwhelming that I could not simply control them on my own. If I had known sooner, had a deeper understanding surrounding mental illness; it could have saved me so many sleepless nights. How is it fair that in school, in life, we are only taught about those serious physical illnesses? Broken limbs and body parts, cancer, diabetes, chronic pain, Sclerosis, lung disease, heart disease; the list goes on. However, the views and attitudes towards mental illnesses and disease are not viewed in the same light. Why? Why are they brushed under the carpet so often when they can have such a huge impact upon a person’s life and state of mind? Their ability to enter the real world, form friendships, relationships. Do the simplest of tasks that one with no mental illness would class as the 'norm'. The stigma upon mental illness as a whole is one of the main reasons hundreds, thousands and millions of people are suffering alone, in silence. If I had a broken leg, a broken arm, people would instantly notice me among the crowd. A person's mental complexity is not always recognisable; it can be in any one of us, any 'normal' looking person. Stand a person with a broken limb next to a person with a mental health disorder. Who will get the most empathy, I wonder. The feeling is almost paralysing. It's like learning to walk again, talk again, breath again, live again. 

I managed to leave the house today. It wasn't for long, but I did it. I managed to eat today, too. It wasn't much, but it filled my stomach and my body later thanked me for it. The feeling is still there, but today as I write this, I feel empowered. I feel positive within myself. Earphones in, ignoring the world. Treasuring every moment I can, as I know it won't last as much as I anticipated. The trembling is back, throughout my whole body. So much so that my whole body is numb, almost as if I have been laid in an ice cold bath for hours, days, weeks. The coldness is almost painful, taking over my body. False persona. We all like to show people how well we are doing. We are all guilty of it without even realising. Sharing our lives with complete strangers across the world, throughout various social networks. It's almost like we seek approval from these strangers, thinking it will someone benefit our character or life after we upload that picture, status, post. When really, we are the same person when we go to sleep that night. We are still the same people. Nothing has changed but our ego. Why do we do this to ourselves? It's like we so desperately crave the attention from strangers when the people who care about us most are surrounded us. But maybe sometimes, that isn't enough. And sometimes, it's almost as if we are all living in a fantasy dream world. 

I can't do this anymore; I'm giving up, losing hope. I thought people called them happy pills for a reason. So, why am I feeling so low? So much lower than before. I can't sleep at night. I'm scared to sleep at night as I'm afraid of what tomorrow will bring. What if I waste another day? Imagine that, being afraid to sleep, afraid to wake up on a morning. I spent today looking at four walls. In the room I am confined in, cry in, sleep in, and dream in. It's my comfort, but it's also my prison- my enemy. I couldn’t eat today, the lump in my throat was too big, it wouldn’t allow me to. I want to eat, but I can’t. I also want to sleep, but I can’t. “You could be worse” they say. “Just smile” “You will be fine”. Since when was my mental state something to be compared to? Those words are degrading, humiliating and ignorant. Because I am still here, because my scars have healed, because there isn't a noose tied around my neck. That's enough evidence for them. I'm still here. Still breathing, living, showing my face; so I must be fine, right? Oh, they couldn't be more wrong. You cannot simply compare mental illness so lightly, as if you are comparing fractions in a maths equation. We are not numbers, we are human beings. Each person fighting their own battle. Why do we also tend to glamorize mental illness? Why is it seen almost like a new trend? Like they somehow make a person cute, but an awkward cute. There is nothing beautiful about a mental illness. They are ugly, they are evil, they are soul destroying. They keep you awake at night and make you question every aspect about yourself; your mind, appearance, your body. They make you question why you are not good enough. Why you are not like the others your age. I would rather have nothing at all and wake up every morning happy and energised, than carry the weight of a mental illness on my shoulders, weighing me down in all that I do. However, I am not and will not be defined by my mental illness, it is a part of me, my life. Where I go, it will follow, but I refuse to allow it to steal my identity. 

It makes you fear the world. Fear the future. Even fear yourself; your mind, thoughts, feelings. You isolate yourself from the world, your friends and the people closest to you who you care for the most. It makes you silent. It takes your voice, your passion. Until you are sat there, weak and lifeless. I wonder what it's like. To wake up on a morning, take a shower, put on your clothes and get ready for the day without a thousand and one thoughts whirling around in your head like a never-ending cycle. I wonder what it feels like to wake up on a morning without a headache, without the urge of wanting to vomit. I wonder what it's like to live an ordinary life. One where you don't over think every minuscule detail. One where you are able to leave you house without panic or fear. One where you are able to walk down the street not being paranoid that everyone is staring at you. Do I have toothpaste around my mouth? Food on my chin? I wonder what it's like to be sat in a crowded room, a loud crowded bus without feeling suffocated. Without wanting to leave as quickly and as desecrate as possible. I wonder what it's like to not have to lie. When someone asks how you are doing to not respond with “I'm just tired”, but to tell them exactly how you are feeling. I wonder what it's like to not wake up with eyelids so tired that they struggle to stay open, struggle to stay awake. I wonder what it's like to go about your day, questioning ho much sleep you think you'll be able to have tonight. Will it be 4 hours? 5 hours? Maybe 6 if we're lucky. I wonder what it's like to be optimistic about the future and not dwell on the past. I wonder what it feels like to say you're happy without having to fake a smile. I wonder what it's like to be in love with your body, every curve and edge. I wonder what it's like not crying in the shower, most if not every day. I've forgotten the last time I didn't feel constantly drained, exhausted. To not wake up every day with the same headache, feeling the same as I did the night before. I've forgotten what it feels like to get dressed on a morning, eat breakfast, without it feeling like an accomplishment. 

I visited my old school the other week. It brought back so many memories. The place I was taught about new ways of thinking, new ideologies. The place I grew, developed and matured. The place I learnt a lot, not just in Maths, Science and English, but about myself. The place I created and developed new, exciting friendships. Friendships that still continue to grow six years later. It's an odd place is school. It's a place where you experience the best time of your life, but to contrast that, the most challenging and difficult times you will face. Isn't it funny how each person is categorised into groups, into status, into 'coolness'. But, in five, ten, twenty years time, the status you once had, the popularity you once gained will no longer mean anything. In the real world, people don't like you for the popular image that you depict of yourself. They like you for being a humble, genuine and kind person. Well, that's how it should be anyway. School can be a challenging time for those who feel alone, feel as if they don't fit in, like the black sheep among the crowd. I remember my first day of my new high school like it was only last week. Year nine, thirteen years old, the age that everyone has already made their friends, already known each other, already knowing the school like the back of their hand. I had never felt so lost. Leaving my friends and family behind. My lovely, beautiful Grandma. Who the next time I would see, would sadly no longer be here. having to start a new life up here, with unfamiliar faces, unfamiliar voices. I hated being the new girl, I never did like drawing attention to myself. What if nobody would like me? What if people were to laugh at my accent and not be able to understand me? A hundred and one thoughts whirled around in my head that morning, as I put on my new white crisp shirt and fastened my long, navy tie. 

I was lucky. I was treated with kindness, respect and loyalty from these people, these people that had never met me before. For once in my life, I felt apart of something, apart of a bubbly and comical friendship group; I knew it was something I would latch onto. They made my days better, more entertaining. Cheering me up when I would get bursts of anxiety, missing my one best friend back at home who was nearly three hours away; ninety two miles to be exact. One phone call away, that's all it would take. But it would never compare to the comfort of her voice, her being, her warmth. Nine years of friendship to be turned into conversations on Facebook, on text, with just the blur of her photo to be seen. Nothing can compare to the love you have for your closest, dearest friends. Those friends that would do anything to see you happy, see you smile, walk the ends of the earth for you. Keep them close, as their love is eternal and I personally, am eternally grateful. 

School was going well, my work and understanding of each subject was also going well. But for some reason, there was an unfamiliar cloud of darkness hovering over me, overwhelming me with a mix of emotions that I didn't quite understand. Tears pouring down face at unexpected times, unsure why Embarrassment, as people would show their concern, asking what the matter what, but I simply couldn't reply as I didn't know myself what was wrong. I had nice friends, a support network, great family, a new bigger house with my own huge bedroom, everything I could need. So what was the matter? Why would I come home from school with tears filling my eyes, so sad and confused? What else would I need? What could I do possibly to fill this emptiness in my head, in my stomach, in my life. I was thirteen years old, I knew I shouldn't be feeling like this. I should be out making memories with my friends, not feeing alone, feeling this way. Time passed and my confidence grew. Although I knew at the back of mind something wasn't quite right, I still pushed myself and acted as if things were normal. I didn't want people to see me like this, see me so weak, like a burden to people. I just wanted to be a normal teenage girl, who would go to sleepovers with- friends, eat too much ice-cream at midnight until she felt sick and giggle herself into a deep sleep. I was a joker. Would make people laugh until they could hardly breath. I liked seeing people smile because of me. Laugh at me. Not at me, but with me. I enjoyed bringing happiness into other people's lives, as it made up for the happiness that was absent in my own. While all of my friends would spend their weekends being sociable, visiting cinemas, parks, town, I would spend most of mine alone, in my room. Watching videos, drawing, eating, to pass time. I remember feeling a bitter jealousy inside of my stomach. Jealous of those friends who could go out, into large crowded areas and enjoy themselves without the heart palpitations, the sweated palms or the sick like feeling in the pit of their stomach.",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,"""The Unspoken Truth""- A short story about my personal experiences with anxiety and depression"

She lives by herself and works a full time job with shitty hours and shitty management, but also spends a lot on her cats or cigarettes. She is into spirituality and healing with rocks (Whatever makes her happy), but also refuses basic medicine when she's sick, and outright rejects the notion of ever going through chemo or radiation therapy if she got cancer, saying that her spirituality group could help her better. That scares the shit out of me.
And now backstory: When I got out of high-school, my best friend died in a car crash a couple days after I graduated. This devastated me (who already attempted suicide twice), and everyone that knew him, especially his ex.


Who I am now in a relationship with 4 years later. ^^^*cough*


I ended up in the hospital in October for 2 weeks for a psychiatric evaluation, and ended up being diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder with severe suicidal depression. 2 days into being in the hospital, my girlfriend was acting distant, and I asked her what was going on. She said she felt a dis-connect between us, and I asked if she wanted to be in the relationship anymore, to which the answer was a simple ""No"". I said goodbye, and didn't talk to her for a month.


After that month however, she said she wanted to talk to me and come over to her place and explain a few things. So I go over, and after about 4 hours of talking, we're back together.
It is now February, and a week ago I called her and told her I needed a few weeks space to figure out how to look after myself and not feel the pressure of a relationship that was already on uneven ground. I've come to the conclusion that, yes, while I love her dearly, I am not in the right space or mindset to be in a relationship, because if I can't even look after myself without worrying about killing myself, I can't possibly try to make someone I love happy on top of that every week.


So right now her and I have had no contact for a week, I'm thinking I need to break off the relationship to save myself from stress that could be a danger to me, but I'm also feeling like that would be a huge mistake and that I need to make sure she's happy. I'm all up in knots, scared shitless to say anything to her and I'm scared shitless I'm going to do something really stupid after I talk to her. I love her so much, but I just can't meet the expectations and function at the same time.


**tl;dr**: In a relationship, I'm mentally ill, she's stressed, she's my dead best friend's ex, can't handle it anymore, but feel the need to make her happy.

Obligatory Dx complications: Really high functioning, just on the threshold, more of a HF PDD-Nos case.... I very empathetic and I understand social interactions... Just I'm not very good with communicating... Too much sensory overload. I'm also an emotionally unstable, yet strangely detached and sarcastic asshole but anyways... Oh and sadist, but the consensual kind so not to worry. Oh and I love chaos, adrenaline and manipulation, so maybe I am just a sociopath or more accurately I have a few more traits than most people.

Let me illustrate what I am talking about by talking about the relationship with a friend of mine, She was my only friend, friend who did care about me, I met her at 12/13, and I'm now 18, she's 19... We were in the same school year group, so we spent a lot of time together. Little did she know how much I liked her until around 14, friendzoned so bad aha. Then around 16 we both had this intense intimate friendship with way too much confusion, and sexual tension... So it was weird and complicated

I don't know why I liked her so much, she wasn't like very attractive in a socially conventional sense, (to me she was of course)... She was only 5ft and blonde with the bluest eyes and... Biggest nose haha... Well big like hawkish (loved it) the tiniest smile, quite not chubby but not average... Clumsy, neurotic, hand flapping awkward mess(I hope you don't read this!) Her smell though, love her pheromones, made my blood boil.... As she has got older now she is very attractive.

She was plain confused by me, because the more I become emotional involed, the less I can communicate, the more I like someone the less I can show them, so it comes out as angry and hurtful, toxic sexually charged conversations, and like what appeared to be false sincerity. It also didn't help that she also had severe mood problems, suicidal ideation, and just like 20  boyfriends *with the criteria of are they stupid and abusive, will I get hurt, so I can build upon my guilt complex and irrational self-loathing?* I often wonder what her childhood was like, her eyes in a childhood photo they were as sad as mine. We shared a past of being bullied outcasts, Haha. She said mine was extreme, very extreme (it was and I spent my childhood years in agony and isolated due to psychosomatic pain disorder on top of being beaten all day and emotionally shredded), but there is something she wouldn't tell me... 

I tried my best to protect her, from shitty boyfriend, to comforting and supporting her after she was raped... I tried so hard, I feel like I failed her because sometimes we fell out and we falled out hard, she however said I really helped. Eventually before we broke contact around (17/18) we fell out every two weeks almost, often her being tearfully angry, I knew what I was doing, just I don't know why I was so horrible. She knew I was a sadist, and I must have been confusing for her, as my mental health tanked, which when she left I had a breakdown, due to secondary trauma, my untreated trauma, depression... Guilt. Started hearing things and stabbing myself/not sleeping. She cared for me a lot and always forgave me... So patient and you know when someone remembers stuff you say? That's so nice, then uses it to be supportive, totally new to being on the receiving end of that!

Later in therapy I started talking about her and I never cried... I spoke about myself very eloquently using my psychology knowledge to be very introspective (without really saying anything haha!). I have some fairly present dissociative symptoms... So I am detached, I sound just as flat, I'm completely well... dead, fish eyes... I look normal but... I feel so far gone. 

Except when I talked about her the psychologist noted how animated I became, and smiling and my voice prosody became normal... Like someone switched me on again. Before hand I figured I was just morbidly infatuated... Except then I realised I love her... I mean, I'm more self-loathing than her so I would rather believe morbid infatuation over all the evidence of my actions and her actions haha. I obviously nearly cried, and stared at the wall. 

(At this point the psychologist was like he's way too complex for standard CBT, abort, abort. Especially as they then refered me on, perhaps because to them that was the only real evidence of non-faked emotional response, then they realised I duped them.)

So naturally I figured I'm only alive when I am with her, don't get me wrong I am perfectly functional, in a nihilistic, permanently avoidant and dark humoured kind of way, I volunteer a lot and help people (totally over compensating!). I could go around the world not giving a shit, on a personal level, I have no self-preservation, x-altruism all that malarkey. Other than human rights and feminism (which is human rights btw) I fight to my dying breath for that. I f'king hate moral hypocrisy. Plus people who are stupid enough not to be nihilists and to tell people what to do as if they have authority to do so in this meaningless universe (which is why I don't kill myself it is as pointless as living)

With her though I redeem myself... Sure she manipulates sometimes, and so do I but we stick out for each other.. we've hurt each other, but the good stuff meant a lot to both of us, She loved/hated how empathetic I am, I could just read her, she expected me to hate what I saw, I didn't. I don't hate anything.

So I decided to contact her again, it was going really well, I was older, so was she. I could just about communicate well enough to clear up the fact that instead of saying I hate her I meant I love her... I can never explain anything to anyone, even here. She even liked the idea of being tied up, and some even more edgy BDSM stuff, so yay wouldn't have to suppress the urge to choke her anymore! Anyways our paths had diverged, middle class me off to university, and her just as smart as me (we're pretty smart I was attracted to her cus she was probably as smart as me), but she's stuck at home regretting her descisions paying her parents all her money. 

So we were just pumping all these emotions into an impossible situation... Until boom it all collapses, I unable to express throughout recontacting her that she hurt me, meant that tension overflowed and I reverted back to being a red-flag spewing psycho.. She is far more mature now and refuses to contact me, and I'm old enough not to send loads of PMs until she responds . She always said that she didn't deserve me, (I know cliché not bs though with her self-image) but it was the other way round I don't deserve her...

So I know you could say all the standard get over it crap, but it isn't just about her it is about the fact that my childhood seriously effected me, I know this and no one intervened, but just at the last window of opportunity I became attached to her, and she has had to endure all my warped... Stuff, she should have never approached me. Maybe we are both messed up. The fact of the matter is, this will be with me for the rest of my life, it will effect my descisions, behaviour, thoughts and feelings... And I lost my chance to get it back, so who knows what I will become and do.

It never got me down or flummoxed before but now I really want to lash out at people for stupid things. I recognise that I am good at my job, but I'm very anxious at my desk and I recognise the reasons why I'm anxious but it still does not make the feeling go away. I cant concentrate, my mind races constantly, I'm getting upset rather easy and constantly in a state of worry. I'm wondering am I depressed or stressed. I cant go on like this for much longer without having a complete nervous breakdown.

This is not something that pops into my head as an intrusive thought, nor is it something that develops in anger or rage. These feelings are usually pleasureful and sexual in nature. I find myself enjoying the suffering of almost everyone around me, but particularly when it is physical. I have seen major accidents and witnessed violence in person and felt a sense of excitement and endorphins released from imagining inflicting the pain myself. 

I am not bothered by the fact that I have these thoughts, but it has been frustrating me lately because I have no way to act them out without ruining my life. I have a good marriage and career and generally like my life, so I see it as important not to take any risks that could destroy everything I have worked for. I also understand that I am likely to be harmed or killed in the process and would never get away with it. 

In the last year, I decided to kill a stray cat just to have the experience of killing something. I lured it with drugged food, bound its legs, and stabbed it in the side of the stomach with a kitchen knife. There was definitely some thrill in the action, but overall not as exciting as I hoped considering the mess and clean up. I do think it would be far more exciting with a person as humans are more understanding of their situation and able to react in more interesting ways. Plus, there is simply more challenge in it. 

I always felt that I could stick to just fantasy and keep these thoughts seperate from my daily life, but my obsession with them is starting to become too much and I feel like I may say or do something stupid at some point.

I can handle things, but, I don't know until when. It took me years to finally reach this point, and even now, I'm still not sure if I should still pursue to get help. And since I just arrived in Canada, I have no idea how stuff work, particularly the healthcare system. 

My first question is where to start. My problem is I have no idea what my problem is. The local resources I see thru pamphlets are for addiction and suicide, I think my problem is neither since I never do drugs or take anything excessively, nor do I plan killing myself that much. I don't know who to talk to. I don't even feel comfortable talking to my parents about it, and they're the only people actually talk to. Where should I go? I'm doing this as discreet as possible so I don't make my parents worried of me. But if I can't, well, that's still okay.

My second question is about the cost. Does the initial thing cost something?

My third question is does it always have something to do with therapy with talking stuff. I don't really talk much. (Which could also be one of my problems, though.) One thing stopping from pursuing help is just me avoiding to talk to other people. But Canadians sure do talk, it's scares me. (But I can still somewhat cope)

My fourth question is should I get help. I've been thinking about this for months. I thought of the costs, my parents getting worried, me exaggerating things, the pretentiousness of me being new in Canada… Then I thought of me struggling with school projects that require interaction, interaction with anyone at all, or pursuing myself to get out of bed and do general things everyday. I think I'm just lazy, shy, and I lack self-discipline. Another thing that pushed me to try to get help is my mom always getting worried of me of forgetting things (and she sometimes notices I just idle unusually). She even had nightmares telling me to not forget going home. I think I'm exaggerating, sometimes not. But then again, I'm able to cope with these things all these years. But they say: (if I get help,) everything  is going to be as clear as night and day. It's just a dilemma. Should I get help?

TL;DR:
New to everything in Canada, where to get help in NT, Canada?
How much does those stuff cost?
Do I need to talk in a group?
Should I get help?

Thank you so much if you've read everything, knowing someone out there read this could enough get me through this day. (Yay! I got the the guts to post these things)

I don't know what to do, I fear he will flip out if he knows he has to stay longer and then he really will stay a while and be depressed or something.

I don't have any questions but I just thought it would be helpful to write down what I'm going through in a space where people going through similar situations may see it.

Last year my wife left me because she realized she was a lesbian. This happened only a few months after I started realizing I was transgender. Her leaving me even though I was planning on transitioning still makes sense for a variety of reasons but I find it very confusing and distressing. I was often depressed before she left me, especially for the last year, but I was able to function mostly normally because I leaned heavily on her to give me direction and purpose. I was never a whole person by myself. But now that she's gone, everything is so empty.

I spend the vast majority of my time in bed. I've set some minimum requirements for myself that I've mostly managed to keep to: eat three meals a day, drink water, go to martial arts twice a week, go spend time with friends at least a couple times a week, keep the house mostly clean. I still manage to meet all my expectations at work, but honestly I work from home and nap most of the day. At night I usually stay up until somewhere between 2am and 5am watching Netflix. The rest of the day I lay in bed doing nothing on my phone for hours, desperately thinking about how I need to get out of bed and do something specific but never being able to find the will to do it. My brain feels numb and unfocused all the time. Disassociating has always been my chief coping mechanism but it's never felt as tangible as it does now. I'm constantly sleepy. I've committed to trying to get at least a straight 7 hours of sleep every night but my success has been mixed. 

I started seeing a therapist and he put me on Lexapro and Wellbutrin. The drugs helped me stop having suicidal ideation (which I've had most of my life), helped me stop getting trapped in cycles of negative thoughts, and helped me regain a little bit of a feeling of purpose at my job. But the therapist is honestly a mess. He refuses to believe anything other than the fact that everything I'm going through is a grief response to the divorce. Maybe because I never really sought therapy before. I told him I'm worried about ADHD, OCD, Bipolar or Depressive, Autism Spectrum, which he pretty much ignored. Every time I go see him it's always ""how do you feel about your parents"" or ""I think last time we discussed that you were having trouble sleeping, how's that going?"" When I see him I can never find the words to express what's wrong, probably because making myself vulnerable like that triggers a big dose of disassociation. He's useless. I haven't told him about my gender identity issues because I don't really feel any trust towards him and it's a very vulnerable thing to talk about. I'm on a waiting list for a therapist who specializes in gender identity and seems like she will be a better fit, but it's been two months on that waiting list. All the therapists under my insurance that aren't shit are impossible to get appointments with.

I miss my ex-wife. We talked about needing space and only spending time together in groups for a while, even though we want to stay friends. Still, even under those constraints I really feel her pulling away from me. She's implied to me that she's having a harder time getting over me than she expected and she needs to be more distant than she expected because of that. I understand, but I miss my best friend so much. And I'm still not a whole person, but without someone to dump all my issues on I'm just a mess.

Edit: I should also add that the only time I feel completely present is when I'm working on my transition. Doing research, shopping online for girl clothes, working on growing my hair out, learning make-up. I guess it's pretty much what I currently live for.",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,My current situation

My brother and I are 3 years apart (him older, me younger) and we had a sort of close relationship- or so my parents could call it that. 
Being the youngest, of course I endured the normal experience of sibling rivalries and constant bickering towards each other. It's normal and I guess somewhat healthy. 
And I had days where we could be civil and play together and actually agree on what movie to watch with dinner. 
But things changed as we grew up. 
I was 10 and he was 13. I was still little enough to be playing with barbies and have a flat chest, but he was struggling with a new environment (highscool), friendships, and that magical package deal of teen hood; puberty and hormones.
Unfortunately, despite my young age, I was physically developing; my hips grew wider, my butt got bigger, and my chest began to bud. 
He noticed. In fact, he was the one that pointed it out before I did. I didn't know what was happening to me, nor did it really bother me. But for some reason, it affected him? I don't know. But suddenly, after a while, he began to do a little more than just hug me, and he hugged me a lot as far as older brothers go. He would sniff me and say I smelt beautiful, and would sort of gush over my 'curves'. I did not feel comfortable and something told me that this was not right, but I didn't understand. And I thought; 'okay, he's older, he knows what's what,' and I trusted him. So I ignored the strings of my doubt and went along with it. He called it Special Hug.

More and more happened each time. And it was like I had no privacy anymore. He wouldn't knock; he didn't see a problem with waking in on me changing or taking a shower. And when we were infants, it wasn't a problem, so I thought it was okay. 
This went on for almost a year, and it didn't stop until the end of 2008. 

During the time, I started to speak my thoughts and I asked him about it a couple times. He would respond with; 'it's okay, we're not really doing anything,' or just 'it's okay and I love you,' 

Really bitch?! Really?!?! 

After while, my doubts kept creeping up on me and made me feel very uncomfortable to point where it would upset and frustrate me a great deal. I wasn't into it and surely anyone would half a brain would have seen that, it was almost as if he didn't care about how I felt, he was just concerned about what he wanted. 

Fucking prick.

When I actually built up the courage to tell him that I didn't want to anymore (not that I ever really did) he would put on this really sad face and hang his head slightly and go; 'oh, okay,' and mope, leaving me to feel guilty and absolutely miserable. Why? Because I did love and look up to my brother and I despite this, I didn't want to lose him. So I caved, and this kept happening each time I tried to stop it. 
It tore me up inside. I was so young, too young. 

What horrible thing does a child -boy or girl- do to deserve this? What could I have possibly have done to deserve any of it? This stuff doesn't leave you. It's dangled like a wind chime in your head forever, even if you stuffed that memory right at the back of your mind, you can still hear its whisper. 

My mum caught him once jabbing me way too much and in certain parts of my body that weren't appropriate, and gave him a big lecture about it, which made him burst into tears and said; 'is that what you think I am? A pervert?' 

Honestly, I snicker at that. I really wish that I could just punch him in the face, I really do. 

After that, it didn't continue. Not that it mattered, the mental scars remain as if it never stopped. And I hate it. 

In all honesty, I do not feel that I can give this the full blame to why I am so messed up inside completely. My self esteem was low, I have high anxiety and I don't feel comfortable with romantic relationships. 
I was bullied for two years and had no friends in that same time period (2008 & 2009) and I was going through puberty before anyone in my classes were (just my dumb luck) and I wasn't very fit and I was chubby because of it- I got body shamed a lot (mostly by girls) and was basically teased and tormented because I didn't really fit in socially, and I was constantly excluded and treated like I was nothing more than the dirt on their polished black shoes.
So, yeah, plenty of things do contribute to my messed up mind indeed, but bullying is something that can (have) be moved on from. 
Being molested and taken advantage of is a completely different kettle of fish. Particularly if it is done by someone who is your own blood; someone who is supposed to protect you and love you appropriately. Someone who is supposed to keep you AWAY from that sort of person. 
I just couldn't believe it. I still can't believe it. 

I was only 10/11 years old. My body may have screamed 12 or 13 but I wasn't. I remained that age between the ears, so again I didn't understand the full extent of how bad and wrong this was and given my discomfort, I buried it right at the back of my mind so I couldn't remember it at all. It took me years to do that, years. It didn't take its full toll on me until I was 17.

He came to me about it. I was 17 and he was 20. I was beginning year 12 and my life was better- I had great friends, I loved my school and I was better socially. 
He however was trapped inside a small tight dome of sadness and sorrow. I felt horrible for him, but I there was nothing I could say or do that would make him feel any better. He was victimising himself, and constantly saying that everyone else was a jerk and that he didn't understand why he was constantly rejected by people. He and his girlfriend had been broken up for nearly a year by then, and the amount of 'friends' he had, minimised. 

I wonder fucking why idiot, they were shitty low lives who used you for rides and alcohol. Fucking duh.

He began to date this new friend I recently made, L, and I didn't know her very well, but I knew enough that she was very superficial and boy crazy so I kept her in small doses in order to maintain my sanity. 
But she decided to eye my brother and he was happy to oblige, despite how uncomfortable it made me feel. I didn't say anything because it was their life, not mine. But the thing is, he's very selfish and jerky when he's happy. I feel so evil and guilty being around him now, because either way, I don't like him. He's an arrogant arse when he's happy  and everything's going his way, and he's an emotionally draining douche when he's down in the dumps. And it's always only one or the other with him, he can't do neutral at all and it's fucking annoying. 
Because L wanted me to come to this event with them and I said no ( I was ill and on my period) he pushed me into coming and did the sad face thing when I said no. I eventually caved and came after all, but I regretted it almost instantly. I counted down the minutes to home time BUT NO it was 12 am and L decided that she wanted him to come over because SHE wanted cuddles and a make out session. 
Imagine being in the same bed as your sibling and their lover as they pash and do stuff in front of you. Feeling uncomfortable yet?! 
I was exhausted and ill, but with no concern for me whatsoever, he instantly agreed.

Fucktard.

And we stayed there until 2 am in the morning. 2 am. She lived at the opposite side of town, at least 20-30 minute drive. I was so angry, but I was too tired to protest, nor did I want to ruin it for him. I tried to dose off in the car, but then he decided to get heated up and angry because someone at the event in our social group said by accident that they thought that he was younger than me. It was so out of the blue when he got angry that i got startled and anxious. He yelled and cussed as if I was the one who said it.i said nothing, but that made me feel even more angry and upset. I felt like crap, I looked like crap, and I felt like all this pressure was forced on me, yet he was the one having a god damn temper tantrum in the car at 2 in the morning? What the hell? 

The next day, I kept myself in my room and refused to come out, even if someone were to beg me. He came in looking normal and chirpy and starts talking about our past like it wasn't a big deal, asking me about it- I tried to brush it off because it had been years and I didn't want it to come back to reality, but he kept going on, saying 'harmless' comments; 'oh, it's just, I read about it, and apparently it can really fuck you up in the future,' 

Really? REALLY?! WHAT DO YOU NEED TO READ TO KNOW THAT MOLESTING YOUR LITTLE SISTER IS WRONG?? AND WHAT RIGHT DID YOU HAVE TO TALK TO ME ABOUT THAT IN A CONDESCENDING FASHION AS IF I WAS THE ONLY MESSED UP ONE? WHY DID YOU FUCKING BRINH IT UP YOU THOUGHTLESS PIECE OF SHIT? DIDN'T IT CROSS YOUR NEXT TO NON EXISTENT MIND THAT IT WOULD UPSET ME? 

Before I could respond, his face had gone all red and he burst into tears and started throwing apologies at me. 
I said it was fine, because again, i really didn't want to hear it as I didn't want to remember it. 
But it was too much. 
I was never good at facing my problems, I always saw as past affairs that are no longer relevant, and if I wanted to respond and get upset, I should have acted when it was happening. 
Hearing this, spending years of keeping this at the back of my mind, it somehow affected me greatly. It was brought back from the dead, the flashes started happening, then the nightmares, it was all whirling in my head, along with everything else that I was still dealing with. I got so stressed. School became hard, communicating with people became hard, my anxiety levels rose up. it was eating me up inside, and it put a real strain my relationship with him. It got so bad to a point where I tried to top myself with mixing bleach with energy drink. Thankfully I was messaging someone at the time and they came straight over and dialled 000. I told my parents about my other problems except that one, because in a way, I felt like I would be betraying him if I said anything. He was on edge emotionally, despite everything that was happening for him, and I thought that this would just go away if I told my new psychologist. 
It didn't.
It made it worse.
I never liked counsellors or psychologists because the procedures were always slow and emotionally draining, almost feeling like they were encouraging me to dwell. I was in year 12 and I had other commitments- I did not have time to DWELL. 
This one also suggested that I ignore him completely, as if he wasn't there. I thought that was complete rubbish and I asked for other strategies. She insisted on telling my mum. 
It was horrible. 
This stranger and I were telling my mother that her son molested someone. That someone being his own sister. It would have crushed her. I'm not a complete brat, I do genuinely care about my parents wellbeing. But later on at home, she asked me to be honest and tell her the truth. Tears obviously weren't enough. She mentioned that I had been dishonest before so my credibility was apparently shaky. Yeah, what serious stuff have a lied about, aside from taking the last biscuit from the jar?! That damaged my confidence in her quite a lot, like she was convinced that I was just a trying to ruin my brother's life, like the awful sister I was, even though it was him that ruined mine. 

She told my dad, and told me that she would speak to him at some point, but was 'worried because he's really on edge,' 
But, I was the one who ended up in the emergency room? Mum? Hello?? 

This was the same person who would constantly death glare any boy I brought home/smiled at me. Saying that he would kill anyone who hurts me, that he would keep me safe, when really, I was safer with those boys than I was with him. He's the one that ruined me to the core, yet here he his acting as if every other guy within my distance was a potential predator. The hypocrisy just makes me want to throw him off a damn cliff.

It just gets harder and harder to be around him now. He spent all of last year on the couch with no job and no life, and telling me everyday what's wrong with feminism and how women are always wrong. It's one thing to have a strong opinion, but having to stomach that same rant everyday, particularly when it conflicts with your views is just absolutely unbearable. Given what he has done, I can't help but scream in my head that he has no right to tell me that nor to force it at me as if he was trying to make me think like him. I still can't have one conversation for more than one minute without it turning into a antifeminist rant. Again, I don't really care, I'm just really sick of hearing it. And I told him that, BUT HE JUST KEEPS CONTINUING LIKE THE DISRESPECTFUL CUNT THAT HE IS. 
And I don't want to hear HIS views on rape and violation because HE VIOLATED ME. Why should I have to put up with this bullshit? Why?! 

My parents don't seem to take any notice of this. Im not comfortable with him kissing or hugging me anymore, or just being in his presence in general. He's at university now in another state, but he's visiting now for my dad's birthday, which is fine, but small doses. I don't go out of my way to hug him to talk to him, I'm just neutral and I pull away every time he tries to hug me. His affection towards me is just too strange and uncomfortable and somewhat creepy. He used to go in my room and go through my things and then get pissed off when I'd tell him not to. When I got some new bras, he was looking at them and started to compare my chest to his ex's. Bit pervy? 

He's strange and tense and I just don't like him or respect him anymore. He's too much for me to deal with and my parents refuse to understand it. Mum is fixated on us being a normal close knit family, whereas there's no such thing. 
I feel forced to have a relationship with him, and I don't want to have one, and it upsets me. It's like I'll have to divorce my parents too if I do him. It's not fair. I love my parents so much and I don't want to lose them but it looks like I may have to after I become an independent adult.

I was raised in a family that kind of inadvertently fostered Co-dependant behaviour through our religion and culture. As a result I have a lot of anxiety when it comes to being independent. I also find myself being very pessimistic whenever it comes to something about my future. I am a very goal oriented person within the confines of what I am allowed to do as a adult woman born to my Muslim family, and I have done my best to excel in school, work or whatever I do. My biggest issue is anxiety. Anxiety that gives me so many painful and negative effects throughout my body. I have come to realize that I always default to thinking the worst could happen to me in my situations, and I worry about it all the time. 

I'm in the middle of leaving my family home without their permission and I will most likely lose my family for a very long time. It's normal to have anxiety in this situation, but I'm afraid my anxiety will really hurt my body. I've been anxious for a week straight.

In the past I have been anxious, but those situations always turned out in my favor and I feel like I might be associating anxiety with success in some strange way. 

Can anyone recommend steps towards a healthier mindset so that I can train myself to stop defaulting to anxiety?

This diagnosis has severely been messing with his sense of identity and confirming in his mind that he's just crazy and will always need treatment. For him, this has just solidified his justification for killing himself.

This morning he said he was at peace with himself because he finally figured out how he was was going to do it. (Not posting the method to avoid triggers, but involves ordering medication online.)

He said he will either do it with my support or without and it was a courtesy to tell me.

From the timeline he described it sounds like I have about a month to work with - sometime before his birthday in May.

He said if I tell his therapist, parents, or call 911, he will just disappear and do it without me.

No amount of pleading or how much I need him to be around is convincing. He says he can't love me if he hates himself so much.

Please, what do I do? If I contact anyone, he'll see this as a betrayal and I risk him disappearing.

Full disclosure: I know the things that I do are not okay. I know I should seek professional help (I have and I am). Posting on reddit is a last resort. So please, no judgement.

Today I did some social engineering to try and find more about my boyfriend's ex. Which is wrong. And I did manage to find out things I had been looking for. But I feel gross about it and anxious and awful. 

I've done many things about my obsession with her that make me feel awful:
-stalk her social media
-pretend to be her on social media as a means of discovering more about her
-tried and hack into her social media, etc.

She lives in a different country or I'd probably try and meet her or something. 

Here's the thing. I've always been obsessed with my boyfriend's exes. I know what triggered it. The first boy I was in love with still had feelings for his ex. He took my virginity and then immediately stated ""I wanted to save my virgnity for [ex-girlfriend] because I love her and not you"". Thus I began obsessively trying to be more like his ex, etc.

It consumes my life. I compare pictures of her and I side-by-side to try and determine who's pretty. Also doesn't help that she's an artist and so am I. So art comparison is huge.

More about me:
I'm a fairly successful person for my age. I work at a high-paying job. I have a 3.8 GPA. I have many friends. I just completed my second gallery show and am working on my third. 

I have an appointment to see a psychiatrist for this very issue and see a counselor regularly. I also meditate and try and maintain a spiritual view of the world. I'm healthy, physically and mentally (except for this one issue). I suspect I may have OCD though.

I've asked random people on the internet to compare us phsyically. And I wish I could share this obsession with someone. I'm just dying to hear ""You're prettier, smarter, more successful, nicer, and have better art"". But I know that's not a reasonable thing to ask for or to want. 

I'm looking for solace. Perhaps someone can relate. Or advice (besides from the 'seek professional help' because I have and I am and it's not doing much for me). Thanks.  ",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,I'm obsessed with my boyfriend's ex and it's ruining my life.

First, I often see myself acting, like it's in a movie. Then, other people are like they're acting, too. Everything feels unreal and I cannot believe it's true in any way. Everything looks unreal, too.

Sometimes, I believe I am in reality in some kind of mental institution, living there being crazy, but in my inner world, there's a completely different story going on (e.g. writing on reddit). Then, some thoughts cross my mind again and again, like in a row. And I get the mental picture of myself in something of a rotating yin-yang-symbol with me in both sides, one happy, one sad, always spinning around. I can differentiate this from reality, but it still occupies my mind.

Then, it's hard to listen to other people. My short-time-memory seems to be kind of weird. Sometimes, I feel like having a billion déjà vus, repeating the same scene again and again (for example, my partner and I sit in the kitchen and eat without talking, then I look at him, he does something, I look away, I look at him again, he does something and so on, in kind of an endless loop; at least it feels like that, it usually is differenciated enough for me so I can see it's not really looped in time.)

Also, I cannot get away from questions like ""what am I?"", ""what does it mean to 'feel' something?"", ""what does it mean for me to have a name?"", ""why am I here?"", ..., I see why these questions are neccessary for a philosophically-interested human, but they're too much in my head since I need to find an answer but I know I never will. I feel, in these situations, very disconnected, not only from my body but also from everything else. I feel like a spectator, living inside a bowl filled with TV-screens that show somebody's life, forcing me to see it as he did.

I feel like a spectator most of the time, even with my own thoughts. And then I think about thoughts and thinking about thinking about thoughts and...

Also, I usually become extremly quiet. I can still talk, and I can still answer, but the answers are short (though usually on-the-point) and I cannot hold up a dialogue.

This all is kind of Ok, but the feeling that nothing, including myself, is anyhow real, that's what bugs me. That's what's giving myself the idea that I am, actually, insane and already in an insane asylum.

I often feel like I am the only thing in existence, and everything else, the stuff I see and hear etc., are just made-up things I created from my mind. This thought never leaves me in such situations (which are often, but not 24/7, luckily).

I've read quite a lot about hebephrenic schizophrenia, and a lot of my stuff matches there, but I'm afraid to go to my psychiatrist and tell him my idea, because, if I'm wrong, I may be assigned a hypochonder and may not be taken seriously.

But except for being kind of quiet, ""outsiders"" cannot feel this. I do not *do* crazy stuff, but think about reality as if I were really crazy. This scares me a lot.

So, what might this be? Might it be schizophrenia-caused or related? And what are further resources to check this out?

-------


Some weird memories surfaced the last couple of years. I don't know how to process this information and am a bit confused.

1. As a kid around 7-8 years old, we were visiting some relatives. I loved computers so the son of the household, 5-6 years older than me, would take me to play computer games. I sat on his lap and his fingers would get uncomfortably close to private areas. Fortunately I had the guts to push his hands away before he could completely get into my pants. ( Holy shit this sounds disgusting after typing that out. :( No idea if it happened just once or more. I don't remember much from being a kid. )

2. In my early teens, I got my own room. Sometimes for some reason I had to share the room with my mother. I remember two nights where I woke up discovering my t-shirt was pulled up and exposed one of my breasts. That only happened when I shared rooms with my mother. Coincidence or did something happen in my sleep? She also asked me once in my mid-teens to strip of my clothes so she could look at my naked body, since ""it's been a while sine she last saw me naked"". I just walked away from her in silence.

3. Verbal abuse? Been called ""broken, ""useless"" (mostly by father) and made fun of in front of other relatives (only mother, example; making spelling errors <- much lol, very fun, my daughter is stupid!) I was often given the cold shoulder if I did something they would disapprove of, i.e; sigh when being told to do a chore, which was ""talking back to them and being disrespectful"". My father would talk to me quite sternly and express his disgust of my behavior and not talk to me for the rest of the day/next morning. The worthless/useless/reaction to sighs thingies are still going on. ( in my 30s now :D )

4. I used to have this semi-weird thing going on. I would think of something nice and immediately or somehow at the same time I'd think the complete opposite. Going from ""Yay, butterflies and rainbows"" to ""I hope the butterflies die and burn in hell"". I would be scared to tears by that. Happens rarely now.

After reading over what I've written, I don't really know what to do about it, since I'm an adult now. Some self-analyzing later this is probably some things resulting in why I absolutely hate being touched/looked at. I don't like talking, since it'll only result in making someone angry or upset. Most of times my brain wants me to die since I was a 10 year old or so.

Could those things like that lead to some kind of trauma/memory-loss? I am however constantly stressed and probably depressed in this environment.

I have been thinking about seeing a psychologist, but I am convinced it'll get me nowhere. Someone got any thoughts about that? Why would I need to see one? Maybe I don't need it after all.

Sometimes I get so tired of crying

And constant, everyday lying

The ""okays"" and ""I'm fines"" and ""everything's goods""

Sometimes I just wish I could 

Say without fear what's on my mind

Spill my guts for the very first time

Every thought that runs its way through my head

And all the times I've wished myself dead

Because it's lonely trapped here in my mind

With nothing but pain and no happiness to find

I try so hard but I just can't tell the truth

Because I'm afraid of hurting you

And I'm afraid of what you might say 

And I'm afraid you might lock me away

In a padded cell with no windows or doors

Where all I can do is stare at the floor

And I guess that's where other mediums come in

Drawing and painting and writing away the sin 

That I committed in being born

Into a family whose minds are torn

And I know I'm not the only one

I have family who know of this lack of fun

But even to them I can't open up 

So I just pour my tears into this cup

Of emptiness, of loneliness, of crippling pain

Knowing that I'm slowly going insane.

I have not left the house overnight for nearly 18 months since I have been living alone. When I sometimes work at night, I leave a webcam on to stream from inside the house so I can check on my mobile. It helps that I now drive a Uber, so I can drive past it also from time to time. when I come back to the house from work, if there's anyone walking past, I walk past, then double back, because I don't want anyone to notice I drive for a living and that I live in that house. My car is parked away from the house. If I see something suspicious, I will try and get the car plates. Sometimes I used to record myself locking the doors to reassure myself that I've locked them properly.

I fear the house getting robbed basically. And my pets are inside too. 

This fear has impacted how i live my life. i turned down a very good  seasonal job last summer which required all expenses paid travelling mon-fri. a couple of months of that would have repaid all my debts and put me in a better position to move out. but I had no savings to do anything before taking on the job. so I turned it down. During that time, I stupidly applied to join the military reserves (not full time service), because I was hopeful that I could either move out, or find someone else to move in before having to travel to a training base (there is a long delay with medical / physical / security, if you're not familiar). But when I was cleared, I was still living alone here, and couldn't face travelling. So I quit. I am ashamed. That I even tried in the first place to protect my country, when i couldn't even protect where I lived. My mother, who lives abroad, has asked me to see her for the past 2 years. Said she'll pay for everything. But I have always refused, because I can't face leaving. 

Is this unreasonable?

How did I get like this? Well in the 4 and half years since I've lived here. The house has been robbed twice. once as I was on sleeping pills, the intruder attempted to smash into the bedroom. it has had its downstairs windows smashed by vandals once. my car was vandalised and burgled twice. once, I was also followed and robbed in the street for drugs, in a case of mistaken identity. the house is near one of those 24hr gas stations, which can attract not nice people. 

It was ok initially. But when things happened, I couldn't move because I was on welfare. now i just cant move because I have too much debt. i can't help but think on one hand, my behaviour could seem odd, but on the other, things have definitely happened.",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,"when does fear become a phobia, hence a mental health issue?"

To put it lightly, I am rather unfortunate in my looks. It never used to really bother me until a series of very traumatic experiences made me very insecure about my appearance and more perceptive towards  how people treat me differently because of it. I am seriously considering cosmetic surgery, like a chin implant or a jaw implant. I really feel terrible, looks definitely matter in the society I was born in. My brother is very good looking and I am the exact opposite. Whenever we are together at a family gathering the difference between how he is treated vs me is like night and day. My mother wont admit it but I can clearly see the difference in treatment. I talked to her about my insecurity and how I know she is treating my brother better but she denies it and offers no support. I don't have anyone to talk to about this so I internalize it and I'm sure it isn't healthy for my mental well being so I'm trying to figure out how to resolve my insecurity and move on and be happy.

My colleague TA was in conversation with a nearby table group about the most attractive people at school. An obnoxious guy from said table exclaimed ""you two would make a cute couple"", to which my colleague TA immediately responded ""eww no, that's disgusting"". The whole class heard and was visibly shocked and some guys were snickering. I got pitiful looks from everyone. I remember clearly the strong feeling of wishing I was invisible. I was humiliated, my colleague TA did not apologize but instead was very pissed at the idea that she was associated with me. The obnoxious guy who said it apologized to HER, saying ""I was just kidding, I wouldn't be as low as to couple you with him"". I had to suffer for 45 whole minutes until the bell rang ... it felt like an eternity. Everyone was silent, there were whispers about people who were deliberating on what just transpired along with pitiful glances from everyone including the teacher. I tried so so hard to hold back tears and I had a huge lump in my throat. When that bell rang I went straight for the exit wanting to relive myself from the situation but two girls called me over and said ""where are you going? I want to talk to you about something."" I didn't want to seem to upset so I stayed to see what they had to say.

Feeling super pathetic that I'm reaching out to a community of people I've never met, but hey, desperate times.
I have had ADD, anxiety, and depression throughout my life but it never extremely affected my daily life until I graduated college. Now I was also diagnosed with avoidance coping, which is a tendency to completely avoid any difficult situation. This means I procrastinate e-v-e-r-y-t-h-i-n-g until the last minute and beyond. I have had months long bouts of suicidal thoughts (with no gumption behind them at all), and just sitting on my ass reading or watching TV and way over eating literally all day because moving would create expectations and self-reflection that could bring about extreme anxiety and depression. It's terrible because I know exactly what I should be doing in order to pull out of this, but I can't bring myself to do it. It just freaks me out and I panic and it's easier to push it off. No amount of trying to self-motivate gets me facing my fears. I am desperate for advice and to hear about any success stories from people who have been in similar situations.

I really hope I'm posting in the right place but if there's anywhere else this should be please let me know. 

I'm worried about my partner and with his permission I'm here to ask if anyone has any similar experiences - we are going to visit a doctor but in the mean time I'd just like to see if anyone has similar problems.

He has exams at the moment relating to his job and this seems to have stemmed from studying for the exams. He tells me he tries to study and he can feel himself losing focus and getting ""fuzzy"" eyes (which we got him glasses for, they helped a little). He says he feels like he wants to just ""shut off"" a very short time after studying and when he tries to re-focus he feels this achey pressure in his head and his head feels full of ""noise"" and he just cannot focus unless he gets absolute silence, which in his job is not often possible.
He says it happens at home too and he gets really stressed at myself and our toddler, he says when he gets this stress and anger it happens again and he gets achey pains in his head and it travels down his body to his legs/back. Then the ""noise"" in his head happens and he finds it really difficult to think about anything.

We are both confused, I'm scared he goes to the doctor and they don't take him seriously - something is wrong and I'm so worried about him and what it could be/what it means,

TL;DR - My partner has trouble focusing, gets angry easily and this makes his head/back/legs sore & his head full of noise.",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,Extremely worried about my partner

I'd still consider myself to be those things in alot of ways. But these days I've realized that the way I value life is quite messed up.

Tonight a friend of mine had a suicidal episode. She has been there for me when I've been through the same, and she's helped me through so much. She visited me when I was in hospital after my attempt. But tonight a part of me wanted her to go through with it so she wouldn't be a bother to me anymore. This is extremely out of character for me. Up until recently, I valued life very highly, especially my friends, but now I've started believing that human life is disposable.

I think alot of people deserve to die. For example, I think serial killers deserve to die. They don't even deserve a chance at redemption in my books. More so, I believe that life is a privilege, not a right. I constantly think to myself ""maybe some people would be better off dead. We'd all be better off without some people."" I guess that probably comes from how low I view my own life. I see myself as disposable, and now I see everybody that way.

My dad has alot of health problems, and I can say with confidence that if he died tomorrow, I wouldn't care that much. If my friends or family die, I won't care that much at all. Again, I wish some people would die so they'd be out of my hair.

I know this is all jumbled and fucked up, and I know what I'm feeling isn't normal. But it feels totally natural to me. It feels like life has any worth, be it my own or others.

I have been suffering from depression and high anxiety (among others) since as early as age 5 (now 34). Up until recently I have never found anything or anyone that was able to help as I grew up. A few months ago I decided to create a webcomic with the goal being to help others who are dealing with these issues and going through tough times. Creatures of Habit (http://www.creaturesofhabit.ca) was born a week ago. It’s a story about a man’s journey through life dealing with his unwanted companions (depression, anxiety, social anxiety). It's a story about resiliency, determination, and perseverance. The comic updates every Wednesday. My goal with the story is to help both those who are currently suffering, and those who know of someone who is suffering. Throughout my life I never had anything or anyone I could turn to for help. I’m definitely not alone in that, but I want to do something to change that. That’s where the idea of Creatures of Habit arose. 

Unfortunately up until early this year I have never really done any drawing, but hopefully over time that will greatly improve. I’d like to invite you all to check out the comic, and hopefully over time the story will be able to help at least one person. If I can make a positive impact on one person, this whole journey will have been worth it. If you like it, please share the comic with others (social media, friends/family etc..).

the issue is that:

i tend to feel sometimes detached from people i know/love. the reason is not clear, but i have mental issues, a combination of depression and borderline personality.
this tendency came to an extreme with my boyfriend, i don't know why exactly, i guess that's because i am close to him, and most of the time i don't even get close to people. so sometimes i feel very detached from him, like one day i love him like crazy and the other day i feel like a barely know him, no emotion connection at all (the reasons that trigger it are very subtle/unnoticeable- sometimes it happens because i think he wasn't nice- when it's not the reality- he tells me a lot that he loves me, and he is very caring)

i tried to share this type of thoughts with him, about the alienation, 'cause i want him to get to know me better, and he tries to understand that, but still very frightened by that- sometimes we really fight over it. he urges me to start therapy.

anyway, yesterday he got an haircut. really cut most of his hair. i feel like he is another person, the alienation i feel is severe. it's not like he is ugly, or something. but i feel like he is a completely different person, i don't know how to handle it.

On the surface I am calm, cool and collected. I'm the type that you wouldn't think has any specific problems regarding the mental state but this is not true in the least. 

I've noticed that I get too attached to people and I end up letting that control my life. It's only come up recently and I do not know what to do.

For example, I really only feel attached to this one girl right now, it is imperative to note though, that this relationship is 110% platonic and is to stay that way. I have noticed over the last two weeks that she has distanced herself from me, not replying to messages and not being as open as in the past. And this drives me crazy with thoughts of abandonment, anxiety, and general nervousness/sadness

I do for a fact suppress a lot of the more ""serious"" emotions. I have not talked to the girl about any of them and kinda feel uncomfortable doing so.

The thing is, I don't know how to classify the problem I have and this is partly due to google searches.

I have googled ""attachment problems"" and things along the lines of that but have only found things and cases of how the person doesn't want attachment or is unusually asocial to family etc.

That part makes me think that this is all in my head but I am legitimately hurting and apologize to anyone if they feel like this ""attachment problem"" is not rooted in facts but I am lost.

Given my familial situation and other generals: I have an amazing family, roof over my head, food on the table, nice car kind of life, so I do not think it is my family's or growing up life's fault at all. 

I feel I am too/get to attached to people and it is unhealthy as I cannot stop thinking about it and drives me crazy.

Other symptoms/possible factors include:
Decreased appetite
Little sleep
In bed a lot
Sad

These other factors all seem to be the results of me searching to talk to this girl/ or any case where I feel too attached.

Also important that note: I have a very solid group of friends who care about me but sometimes chide me as all friends do, I spend a lot of time with them so telling me to spend more time with them wouldn't really make sense because Im very busy already

This problem is also distracting me from my studies , please help, I also don't know if I can talk to this with my parents or a professional because I feel rather uncomfortable about it.

I was recently diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder, and I'm considering suicide. This isn't a cry for help, a means to get attention, nor a condoning of the act, although borderlines are known for attention seeking. I want a personal opinion on whether or not you believe this is the ethical decision. I have been the primary source of my families dysfunction for the past few years, I would make an almost weekly suicide threat, and have recently turned to drugs. My parents, sister, and best friend are all pretty worried. I don't want them to worry, but I honestly and truly believe that they would be better off without me. My sister has crippling anxiety, so losing her primary stressor would relieve a great deal of that. My parents are going through financial hardship, so no longer need to pay for a second child's college should assist in that regard. Moving on to why the way I am, growing up I always viewed myself as the type of person who is filtered out during natural selection. I described myself as a defective product that needs to be removed from the assembly line. However, with this new diagnosis, it seems more like I should be putting down Old Yeller. Borderlines are generally viewed as abusive and unstable. All my relationships have ended in disaster. BPD's are essentially incapable of long-lasting relationships, so a family of my own is impossible. I will only be happy if I am loved so I need a family, my parents are quite old and won't last forever. I also display very manipulative tendencies. I have a romantic inclination toward my best friend. BPDs are defined by having and unimaginable fear of abandonment, I would often threaten suicide if I even remotely feared she would leave me. Her father left her so she doesn't want to give me the same fate, but I see I am taking my toll on her. But if I can so easily manipulate the one I love the most, perhaps I deserve to die. I can feel empathy for others so I know I'm not a sociopath, but I feel emotions on a rare occurrence. I only feel them when I can no longer control them due to intensity. So a life lived without love, hardly any feelings, and being a burden on my loved ones does not seem to be an ethical life.

Many are like me, barely hanging on financially, marginalized, and using state resources to pay for medication and care. All it would take is one event to polarize the nation and gain momentum for mass institutionalization. 

Several years ago I had a lithium overdose. Doctor prescribed too much and wasn't monitoring my levels. I had a seizure in the mall. At the ER the staff ran a lithium level and it was dangerously high. Without my medication bottle to prove I was taking it as prescribed it was ruled a suicide attempt and I spent a week in the psych wing. Even after my doctor called and explained the error. Just like that. A week of my life gone. No due process. No civil rights. We have less rights than the general public. I don't think many people realize that. I've spent 6 months in hospital before on a doctors say so. There is no oversight. We are incredibly vulnerable.

In the end, all we have is each other. What are we, as a community, going to do to make it? To keep from losing SSI, Medicare, Medicaid, Section 8, and all the other programs we count on.

If they turn on us nobody is going to help us. History proves it. My personal experience backs history up. Once you're labeled as ""other"" society gives itself a moral pass.

Taken all the anti-depressants, all SSRI's, all SNRI's, Tricyclics. 

Had ECT 14 times, works for a month. Can't handle getting a seizure induced under anesthesia so often. By the time I get my bearings and full cognitive capacity back following a treatment, it's time for another treatment. I was never afraid of the treatment but started having nightmares about it, being suffocated by the oxygen mask and recalling the seizure in my sleep. Apparently, my subconscious doesn't care for the treatment that much. 

I'm awaiting TMS, my local clinic only has one chair and my state's insurance companies only recently started covering the treatment. So there is a backlog of patients.

Doesn't help matters that my previous longtime psychiatrist/therapist got caught banging one of her patients and lost her medical license over it. Now I'm having a hard time locating my medical records. Cigna won't authorize TMS unless everything else has been attempted and failed,.and 8 years of treatment is currently missing. 

The longer I wait, the clearer it becomes that TMS may not be helpful to me at all. I'm trying to stay optimistic, but the evidence is weighing heavily on my optimism. 

I don't know what else I can do. I diet, exercise, and sleep. I've tried all the ""mental health"" diets. Went and had a sleep study done, I had some apnea so they gave me a CPAP, it doesn't help. When I'm having depressive episodes apparently the brain won't let you fall into rem sleep, and no drug can make that happen. Drugs like Ambien will put you out, but it doesn't mean you're going to sleep. 

I don't know what else to do. I have the desire to commit suicide, but I lack the conviction to do so. I constantly have to remind myself that it's not an option, just to put the thought out of my head. 

It's affecting my ability to work, so now I'm on my wife' s insurance. I've started to become cynical, I feel like doctors only become doctors to wear lab coats and make money and be called a doctor, it has nothing to do with helping people anymore. I can tell they're tired of trying to treat me, I don't blame them. It's hard to find a doctor who's up for a challenge. ",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,I don't know what else to do...

I have struggled with depression for a while and I went in one weekend when I was feeling particularly hopeless because I knew that it was the best place to go for emergency help (what my therapist advised me). I went in and felt good after the initial interview, which was with a nice lady that was friendly to talk to. They took my bag and my belongings, understandably. 

I was locked in the waiting room for seven hours without being given any updates. I had no idea what was going on - I had gone in alone and didn’t tell anyone I was there. They brought me in for three separate interviews with three different people (one of them was completely patronizing). I was asked the same questions over and over again in each interview, and when I asked for updates nobody would give me any. They finally let me leave after begging them because I didn’t want to be there any longer. I had initially gone in because I was having a breakdown and felt like I was going to hurt myself. I ended up leaving CAMH feeling worse than when I went in. 

Needless to say I am feeling very hopeless about getting help and my trust for mental health practitioners is basically non-existent. I am wondering if anyone has had similar experiences at CAMH? Maybe I won’t feel as isolated if I hear other stories. Also, does anyone have any advice on where to go for help with depression that is maybe not as discouraging as my experiences so far? On top of CAMH I have also had bad experiences with therapists and doctors. Also for the record I live in Toronto, so open to anything in the GTA.

I was curious if anyone else has ever experienced paranoia in the form of intrusive thoughts with Venlafaxine? I know a lot of people loathe the medicine and there are a lot of negative side effects, especially when stopping. I started venlafaxine over 2 years ago at 75mg and slowly increased to 150mg for the last year. It seemed to be working okay when combined with Welbutrin.


 Fast forward to about a month ago and I finally decided to bring up some issues I've had with my heart rate that has been going on for over 2 years to my internal medicine doctor. Basically what happens is that I will be sitting or laying down and my heart rate should be at a resting pulse. But, at random times it will jump up to over 115 and as high as 170. Then at other times, it feels like my heart is racing, I get out of breath and feel sick to my stomach but my heart rate is only around 80. I am a healthy male, 5'11"" 170lbs, average shape, I go hiking, like to play sports, and use the elliptical or stationary bike for cardio.  Long story short my doctor gave me a Holter monitor and then was going to give me beta blockers but due to something where the top chambers and lower chambers get out of sync every once in awhile he didn't feel comfortable with that. He decided to up my Venlafaxine to 225mg as he thought it might be anxiety.

This last month has been very weird. I have experienced what I consider paranoid irrational intrusive thoughts, especially at night time. I know these thoughts are not logical but the emotional side of me gets nervous/anxious even though the logical side is telling me to stop. For example, when I turn off the lights at night time and am walking to bed I fear that someone will be next to me trying to stab me as soon as the lights go off, or someone will rush me from down the hall. Another example is when walking outside at night time I am paranoid someone is behind trees waiting to attack me and they are running and hiding behind tree's until they have a perfect opportunity to attack. I know these aren't valid thoughts when I have them but I cannot get them out of my head and I start getting anxious no matter how many times I tell myself these thoughts are not valid. 

Has anyone else experienced anything like this? I am going to my doctor today and planning on telling my doctor. It does not feel like it has helped with the heart issues but instead made me more depressed/anxious and paranoid. I guess I need to be told that I am not absolutely insane or validation that it is the medicine. I am not sure actually what I need, I just felt like I needed to talk to others who might experience similar issues. 


Thanks in advance!

I'm not exactly a stereotypical loner; I've been trying to get involved in social activities recently (despite REALLY hating the people there), I can hold a conversation with a stranger relatively easily, and I have a small handful of friends online I can talk with about lots of things. I've also had a significant other in the past; however, it was a long distance relationship that took place entirely online, and we never actually met up. That in and of itself might be unhealthy, and it may contribute to why I justify having an imaginary S.O.

I'm concerned about whether or not having an imaginary S.O. is bad for my mental health. I only really ""hang out"" with her when I'm in bed, so it's not like I insert her in other parts of my day. I'm also totally self-aware of a.) how unusual it seems, and b.) the fact that it's entirely a fantasy of my creation, intended to make me feel as though I have a significant other. What I'm particularly concerned about is the fact that my pretend partner is actually a cartoon character. Not only is she a fictional character, she's a character I've had an attraction to for a long, long time. I only really stopped caring about her once I started a (virtual) relationship with a real person, and once that ended, it took quite a long time to imagine being with this character again because I felt like I was too old to keep doing it. I even did No Fap for 90+ days just to see if those feelings would dissipate (spoiler: they didn't). 

From what I've read, there isn't exactly a consensus on whether it's okay from a mental health perspective. The two leading opinions seem to be that it's either an unhealthy coping mechanism for dealing with loneliness, or perfectly healthy as long as it doesn't interfere with your everyday life (like I said, my imaginary S.O. doesn't really do that). I just want to know so I can take the appropriate action.

Is it normal or, more importantly, healthy to pretend I'm in a relationship with a fictional character? Does my self-awareness and relatively low-profile behavior with this ""person"" make it any healthier? I'm already going to ask these questions to my therapist the next time I see her, but I wanted to get a broader amount of opinions just to see if I can get a head start on taking whatever action I may need to take.",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,Is it mentally unhealthy to have an imaginary significant other?

I have mental health issues I'm not really functioning and cannot do anything of my own. After alerting my family they had little concern and showed little sympathy for me. I urged them to hire a professional because they know nothing about bed bugs. They won't do this and instead are intent on replacing the bed and mattress. They don't get that that's not a solution. These bed bugs could also be in other places and we don't know it. They could travel to the new bed/mattress. These bed bugs could've been in the mattress a long time without us realizing it. They're more concerned about where they came from (i.e. placing blame on myself and other housemates, being negative and denying) than coming up with a solution. When I try to explain my worries and offer my opinions they write me off, ignoring me and act like I'm crazy (seeing that I'm mentally ill this gives them reason to cast all sorts of judgments). Their solution sucks buying a new bed and mattress won't make the problem go away. We need a professional to examine the house. But they won't do it so IDK what to do. If you can imagine this has severely effected me to the point where my skin crawls and itches everytime I enter my room (that disgusting mattress and everything still in there and I need to get stuff out of my room). I am sleeping on the couch now but it haunts me at night because of how bed bugs travel. They keep insisting their beds and the couch are okay but how do they really know for sure? Why don't they get it that we need a professional? I told them this but they just won't listen to me. I was shaking yesterday and really emotional but my family was really an a**. This really effects me on a deep level for a number of reasons and the people in my life can't even be empathetic. They knew and know nothing about bed bugs but they still wanted to ""school"" me on it and act like they are professionals when they aren't. They didn't believe me when I told them, and even when they see them themselves they said crap like ""it's only one"", ""there's not that many"", even going as far to say that old mattress still looks good despite the fact there were clear blood stains on it from the bed bugs.",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,Bed Bug Problem and Mental Illness: Family refuses to hire professional

First off, I use a lot of social media. Many people use Facebook and Twitter but the website I associate myself with is Tumblr. Basically on Tumblr you make a blog and you reblog other things you like. It can be anything really as there will always be a topic or community you can relate to. My blog focuses on video games for the most part but it has a lot of other things too. There is no real theme I guess you could say.

One of my hobbies is drawing and art in general. I have been drawing for a long time since I was a kid but I was never particularly good at it. You know those people who like to do something but they never take it too seriously so nothing much comes out of it? I'm one of those people. I used to draw stick figures on paper with video game fan art being the recurring theme in my scribbles. Lately, I tried to improve my skill due to me simply getting frustrated with stick figures and I try to make my drawings look pseudo-realistic at least in the ""anime"" sense which the only reason my drawings look vaguely anime is because I'm taking after many Japanese game artist styles. Yeah, I know the hypocrisy with anime being realistic but I hope you know what I mean. But I apologize for rambling as this is only loosely relevant.

My problem is that when I use Tumblr (or any social media), I cannot help but browse through other more ""superior"" works of fan-art. I cannot fathom how someone is so good at a skill when I cannot ever see myself making pictures as gorgeous as some of the things I see on Tumblr. Then because the website has a like system (similar to upvotes on Reddit) you are even more aware of just how inferior you are to the most popular of artists. No doubt it is hard to become a successful artist, especially one that makes money off commissions, but this trend of displaying art on social media has done a massive number to my self-esteem. 

I hate myself. I hate myself so very much. The fact that it's so hard for me to draw art (let alone have the willpower to pick up a pencil) fills me with anger towards myself. One of my hobbies is actually collecting fan works for obscure video games and I very much enjoy doing that but this intense jealousy is something of a recent thing. I know a few people who are more professional than an amateur like me and they also draw stuff for commission money. Their entire livelihood involves drawing things for other people and getting paid for it. Part of me wants that existence but I also don't want my hobby to become work. I do not know why I hate myself so much or why I constantly compare myself to other people especially since I don't really believe talent exists so much as the human brain becomes more skilled in something the more times it attempts that skill. I honestly don't try very hard but it sure does seem like I try a whole lot. When I draw and I make a small error, I get angry about it. Multiple times I thought about ripping up my own sheets of paper which had failed artworks on them. Sometimes I scribble all over the paper and write big Xs with text like ""Why the hell did you draw this?"" and ""What are you doing with your life?""

There isn't any fun or relaxation in my hobby anymore and my constant use of Tumblr (which I use almost everyday, hours on end) inevitably exposes me to other people's gorgeous fan-art which I admire but also, at the same time, is my enemy. I am my own worst enemy actually. Nobody beats me down and makes me feel like trash the same way I do to myself daily. I hate that I cannot draw worth a damn. I have a deviantart account too (which I only used to upload some of my dumb drawings, the website is mostly populated by young people amateur artists like me) and when I look through my crappy gallery, I want to delete it all. Sometimes I think amateur artists like myself do not deserve to post their works online because it seems this world only loves those who are extremely skilled in their craft. Nobody cares about the so called worthless wannabe artists that think they made something cool that another person could possibly like. Essentially, because better people exist, I cannot love myself. This is obviously a destructive mindset so I would like help on how I can change my point of view. Thank you for taking the time to read this wall of text and once again, I apologize if I made an error in someway. 

TLDR: What can I do to accept the fact that I am a mediocre artist and that it's okay to be a mediocre artist? How do I stop comparing myself to people on social media who are better at their craft?",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,Social media and inability to respect myself

This issue is with my friend, let's call her Mary.  

Some Background Information 

This all started about 5 years ago when Mary (now 53) was diagnosed with depression, on top of her diagnosis of extreme anxiety. She spiraled downward and was only helped when her husband Joe dropped everything (work, hobbies, extended family etc.) to support her. Eventually she started regularly meeting with a therapist, taking the appropriate medication, joined weight watchers, and did some light activities and exercise.  

About a year ago we noticed she started eating very poorly, and stopped all exercise. Mary blamed it on menopause. In the summer she was diagnosed with a heart condition (Not sure of the name). Mary refused to eat healthy and exercise and instead chose to take medication to fix the issue.  

It's currently gotten to the point where Mary has lost almost all motivation to do anything. She no longer does any exercise stating that she can't ""because of her heart"", although I think that her anxiety has a lot to do with it. She won't even join the them on a Family walk around the block. She also refuses to eat healthy, it's not uncommon for her to eat half a tub of ice cream and a quarter of a cake a night, I think this may have to do with her depression.   

Joe and the rest of the family (kids) have all tried to bring her new poor habits to her attention. Mary laughs them off and continues on her way.  

She now refuses to accept any type of help, she won't go see a therapist, psychiatrist, psychologist, etc. And she cannot go back on her anxiety or depression medication because it interferes with her heart medication (or so I've been told).   

So here's where I need some advice! I am frustrated and we have tried so much, but Mary doesn't seem to grasp the concepts that her actions are affecting herself and those around her.

**TLDR:** My friend is Depressed and has high Anxiety, she refuses to change her poor lifestyle, see a therapist, and cannot take any medication. The family is getting frustrated because she won't make any changes to help herself.  

Questions: 

* How to you convince someone to get the mental health help they need if they can't see that they need it themselves?  Mary is aware of her previous diagnosis of depression and anxiety, but she says this time there is nothing she can do about it because of menopause and heart medication, and she is unwilling to try.  

* How do you get Mary to find the motivation within to eat healthy or exercise? Mary has already had a medical scare, the family continuously points out her new lifestyle but she brushes it off several times a day. Joe has even hired a nutritionist and weight coach for the two of them, but Mary has absolutely no interest. ",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,Caught in a Predicament any help is Appreciated [Canada]

I realized something the other day: I never notice getting close to people, or maybe I just don't get close to people. After getting to know someone a little bit, they'll hug me or show affection in some way and it usually confuses me. I enjoy being around these people and all but I never noticed that we were close enough for stuff like this. 

A while ago, a girl who I'd consider a friend said ""you're like a brother to me"" and I was happy because she's a really fun person but I just had no idea our relationship was that close. 

Usually what happens is the other person will kind of set the tone for the friendship and I just go along with it (ex. They start hugging me when we meet/say goodbye and then I start offering them as well in these scenarios). 

My problem is I feel everyone else has the ability to know exactly where the relationship is at but I have no clue. Is this a sign of slight autism or do I just suck at socializing? What can I do to improve this?

I'm 20, Male and in the UK and all I think about is suicide and homicide. This all started when I was relatively young and used to think about harming siblings or friends at school, at age 8 I went to see a therapist who concluded I had OCD as I used to obsessively hand-wash and have to repeat things otherwise I'd become anxious and distressed. 
Only once did I ever buckle and follow through with my 'intrusive thoughts', slamming a friends arm in a door for no reason other than the fact I had thought about it and impulsively followed through with the action. Eventually I lied and told my parents i was feeling better and urged them to stop therapy, which they did.

Fast forward to 13 and I was being extensively bullied, burned with lighters, beaten up, I even got pushed out of the school bus while it was still moving (slowing to a halt mind you). This was a very traumatic time for me as I'd wish I could just die, I'd cry every night after school and it broke my mums heart to see me like that but the guys responsible were at least 16 and far bigger than I was, I'd always been the type to stand up for myself no matter the size of my bully but this broke me and shattered any confidence I had.

For years afterwards I was the quiet kid in school, I'd sit at the back with earphones in and my head on the desk, teachers eventually realised I was not going to work and they left me to it. By 15 i was spending every waking moment fantasising about my own death or the deaths of those around me, I didn't tell a soul about how low, alone and worthless I felt.

One day after sixth form (I'd of been 18) I decided I'd had enough, my younger sister would be out late because of football, my parents were both working and I decided I'd end my life. I went home feeling slightly relieved I was finally going to rid myself of this horrible feeling. I'll cut the details but moments before I could do anything I felt a sudden wave of guilt and thought of my sister, I have two but I adore my younger one, she looks up to me and I'm very protective of her, the moment I thought about how much pain I'd put her through I felt sick and couldn't do it, instead I spent the afternoon crying and feeling awful. 

I eventually told my mum how I felt and she took me to see a doctor, I was referred to First Step and started to see a therapist who thought i was suffering from OCD. For reasons unknown to me I was referred to another therapist who told me that it was all in my head and that as long as I didn't act on my thoughts he didn't see the issue. I told him that I think about Necrophilia a lot and he told me ibwas just sexually frustrated and recommended I find myself a girlfriend. I couldn't believe it.

I stopped seeing him and decided I could go it alone.
Almost a year later and I'm worse than ever, I dont want to wake up every day, I don't want to see anyone, family, friends, coworkers, strangers. I just want to close my eyes and never wake up. I feel like I have a hole in my chest and no matter what I can't fill it. What is this? Is this life? I can't seem to move on or past this, people have gotten tired of me being so dark all the time, people are tired of hearing about my issues and how I feel. I have nobody. My closest friend feels uncomfortable when I open up, I don't blame him because what are you supposed to say when someone dumps all their issues on you?

I forgot to mention that I have self harmed in the past, rather severely one time. Nothing that required hospital but I do have a horrible 7 inch scar on my arm now and that's a constant reminder that I'm weak. At least in my eyes. I want to stop feeling numb and like nothing matters to me. I used to adore gaming and going out with friends and now I can't bring myself to even load up my console or get out of bed for nights out.

Please reddit can you give me some advice? 
What is wrong with me? 
How can I feel better?

I refuse to believe I feel this way because I don't have a relationship and that I'm just sexually frustrated (in actual fact, my sex drive is almost non existent).

Recently, they have became pretty much consistent, and I'm no longer able to function day-to-day.

About a month ago, a friend managed to convince me to go to hospital (I'm still unsure *how*), but apparently I was quite out of it and rather paranoid. For about three-four weeks, I was pretty convinced the government was trying to control my mind (minor flaw with that idea; the UK government is too incompetent).

I've since had quite a lot of rather troubling hallucinations, and ended up being referred to the local Crisis Home Resolution Team after I tried to shove a knife through my stomach (I'd managed to convince myself someone had poisoned me... not sure how stabbing myself would've helped, but eh... :P)

Anyway, I've since been bounced between the CRHT, the local Community Mental Health Team, and the Early Intervention for Psychosis Team, and it seems like none of them are really listening to me.

For example; the last appointment I had with the CMHT, I had written quite a bit about... well, everything. They took a five second glance at it and went ""meh, ok."" I tried to insist they read it, but they just said they'll take a copy and read it later - fat chance that actually happened.

Anyway, their current working theory is Borderline Personality Disorder with Quasi-Psychotic symptoms. Which, maybe they are right, but as I say, it really seems like they aren't listening to me, and I don't really feel I fit most of the BPD criteria (which is rather amplified when they say I'm suffering from things I'm *really* not).

I'm not really sure what to do; on one hand, I really don't want to cause a fuss. They may be right, and I may just be overthinking things. But on the other hand, I don't want them to push me down the wrong path - CAMHS already did that to me as a teenager, and it took almost two years to recover afterwards. I can't help but feel this is happening again.

If it *is* happening again, I really need to bail. Like, now. But I'm not sure what to do in that situation; I really do need to get better, I can't live like this for much longer. Dealing with depression was a piece of cake compared to this; I'm scared and tired, and I just want it to stop.",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,Not sure what to do anymore...

So I've had depression for a few years now. My Bf knew this before he asked me out so it was no surprise to him. I used to get upset and his own words I became emotionally dependent on him for happiness. He called me a 'burden' on him and told me he didn't love me. I later took him back although it was agreed I wouldn't mention my illness again to him.

The next few months there was only a few minor blips. Although he became more controlling advising me to take up hobbies, get out of bed earlier to stop me oversleeping, eat healthier and exercise. He went as far to say that he would find me more attractive if I were to lose weight (I'm 10.5 stone for those wondering). Comments also became focused on my clothes, make-up and general appearance. He began to show lack of respect in terms of disappearing off to other commitments such after I had an operation and mid way through my birthday meal for example.

I was wondering if it is possible my depression and dependence on him drove him to behave in this way? All I ever did was love him but I'm not sure why he even bothered to stay with me if this is how he felt. He even joked that he was my carer but we'd see each other a few hours a week normally at the most. At some points he banned texting during the day.

So the advice I'd really appreciate is what I can learn from this for future relationships? Do you think my depression made him treat me like this because he felt I was a burden? Should I hide my illness to future partners?

I go to therapy every couple weeks or so and I've been diagnosed with anxiety and I've read that's common with dprd.

Is it supposed to be triggered by nostalgia? Because whenever I go somewhere or remember a certain memory that happened in the past I go into this cloudy state of feeling like I'm living in a bubble in that moment and I feel very spaced out. This usually only lasts a few days (sometimes a week or so at most) and then it's gone.

I began to feel uneasy with the world around me- I constantly felt like nothing good was happening- or my life had gone completely stagnant. My parents said its because I've
been cooped up in this house so long that I've burned out on home life. They Might just be right- but things continue. I began to grow more and more stressed- constantly changing
my room to stupid layouts just because it was a change, I seemed to have developed a strong feeling- almost a fetish of getting furniture- some of it not even needing!


I was going insane! I started to fight with others- I even began to stop playing games some days- I am an avid gamer.
Some days I don't even bother to get out of bed. And worst of all the thought of completely giving up has crossed my mind. I don't mean suicide- I mean just stop functioning physically and
emotionally- If I die I die, too bad- that kind of thing. I'm often keeping these thoughts to myself mainly because my family would look at me like a complete wacko and would probably try to find me therapy or some crap.


I'm starting to get almost depressed when I finish a game with a story due to the fact that I feel that the world in there is much more suitable and exciting than the one out here. I WANT SOME CHANGE.

My mind is not normal, and I've been using my abnormalities to my advantage all my life. 

Essentially I constantly adopt emotions, and have never had personal emotions before. I look to others to adopt the most appropriate emotional state, if I overhear a discussion on depression I'm depressed for a long period of time, if I hear or read material on happiness I become overly happy.

Obviously this sounds ridiculous, but these are almost like triggers, alternating between periods of mania and depression upon exposure to emotions from others.

I've known about this mechanism for some time, and used it to study. Exposing myself to successful people increases my drive, makes me feel like I'm high on something. 

I don't know whether this is the result of priming, or something else. I've searched around but have found details on no similar symptoms. 

Obviously there is nothing ""wrong with me"" in the case that I am not going to commit suicide, but something tells me that I am still not normal, that I constantly look to others to create emotions, and without exposure am left hollow.

I'm not sure if this is my mental illness paired with my hormones but everyday is worse than the next. I'd like to believe I'm extremely creative, but my life on a day to day basis is so fucked up I can't even explain it. If I could pair it to a color I would mix grey with black, I can't keep living my life in such a fucking bubble of structure and rigidity. I think there are some days that are better than the rest but I wear a mask of happiness & nonchalantness almost 365 days in public but at home I'm such a sad individual. I know everyone else is too, why is everyone hiding? I design clothes & help direct film, I also smoke a ton of weed because if we're being honest- it keeps my mind idle, and I'm scared of what my mind will wander into when I'm not high. I have insanely creative and out of the box ideas but sometimes it feels like no one listens. I think every single day I stay stuck in this system I deteriorate a little more inside. I don't want you all to think I'm some hormonal teenager because I've felt a little different since I was 10 (back then everyone used to fuck with me and think I was this terrible kid), it honestly feels like I'm in a heightened state of consciousness 24/7 and the high makes me feel ""normal"" I guess *insert shrug*. I need a way out into the real world, I can't keep living like this. I think mental illness is in my genetic makeup, one of my parents suffers from Depression & bipolar disorder and the other one is too detached. Basically I'm just writing this to tell myself there are other people like me because a couple weeks ago I forced myself to stop smoking everything started feeling too numb and now my mind is fucking me :(

Ever since I can remember, my mother has displayed some rather unusual behaviors. Often times, especially when she is stressed out, she will start whispering to her self followed by a chuckle and then more whispers. We have been on the phone at times and she has zoned out and began to do this (which as you can imagine can be quite disturbing). When she is in a good mood, she will just laugh for hours in her bedroom. She claims she is ""just thinking"" but will never have a specific funny event to share. In general, my mom is quite distant (in her own world). She has no problem having a long rant about her issues but it seems as soon as anyone else starts talking about themselves, she zones right out. At one point, the zoning got so bad that even if you snapped your fingers in front of her face she would not react. Once she threw herself on the floor and starting screaming at me while pounding her fists on the floor ""I want milk!!"". A few years ago, she stopped taking her anti-psychotics and she saw a person who was not there in the corner of our apartment. Is this associated with any personality disorder? I couldn't find anything similar on the internet.  The symptoms change from what seems like one condition to the next over the years. 



Background: My mother has been diagnosed over the years with everything under the sun.

Then all they suggest is focusing on other things and exercise but thats pretty much all they suggest. No matter who I go to. It doesn't help at all and despite doing those things I still remain depressed or anxious.

Recap of my mental condition

 January 2016 I went to the hospital with the intention to be diagnosed and treated for ADD. I was diagnosed with persistent depressive disorder, and anxiety. ( the long lived state of depression was at the time roughly 6 years long.) Starting when my parents split up at 10 years old, and me being 16 at that time. I've been on medication since, it's not completely helping right now but I'm working on that and have an appointment set with my doctor. I've never consider the possibility of me having separation anxiety before. But I never thought that I had anxiety until entering a relationship with someone who was able to educate me on the signs of anxiety. I now see that I do have struggles with anxiety especially over the past few months with them getting worse. My anxiety attacks have been coming on more commonly, thankfully I've recently learned a way to stop them before they take over.
(I was diagnosed with ADD one month ago Feb 2017)

Anxiety triggers, and other related info

•Fighting/ arguing with loved ones.

•Unexpected/ unplanned departure from loved ones

•Remembering the first point

•Sometimes I will just get really sad, at this point I don't want to live at the moment, and this triggers my anxiety because I really do want to live a long happy life

•I'm very attached to my girlfriend, and can get really jealous. (I usually don't let it show but it just dwells with me in my mind)

• I sometimes  feel like if I can't make a loved one happy then it is my fault for their current state of sadness. I'm aware I didn't induce it but I feel it's my obligation to see them happy.( Bringing joy, and laughter to people is one of the only things that bring me real happines)


My girlfriend of one year that I mention above has BPD, one of her symptoms include separation anxiety so I do have a first hand look on the condition.

Exercise #1, Phobias: Break down the specific elements of the fear into several pieces and try to overcome each piece and create an A-Z journey.

Exercise #2, Regret: The psychologist describes regret as your soul being trapped in the past and how each memory that elicits a negative emotional response needs to be evaluated and learned from, much like a ""what doesn't kill us makes us stronger"", so you can move forward.

These are all just basic summaries of those examples, but I'm referencing them because I'm here in /r/MentalHealth, soliciting your help for a motivation exercise that would be similar. I really need it right now. I need a worksheet on motivation that I can fill-out for this problem I'm having.

--

Problem: I'm feeling unmotivated to go to Jiu Jitsu class, despite an absolute passion for it that I think about everyday 

I have a gym class membership in Minnesota. It's both expensive and the learning curve is noticeable. I mention those because, if I don't go, I regret wasting my money on it and also worry that my classmates, who were once novice level, are getting better than me. It's a martial art called Jiu Jitsu...

-I want to become a black belt in it, which takes a decade to achieve, which is another reason why it's time critical. I've wanted this for several years, but I'm not even 25% there. There is a lot of regret in waiting so long to pursue this, compounded by the days that I don't show up to class.

-I want to fight other people in Jiu Jitsu tournaments. But I'm afraid of losing, to the point where I don't like losing to classmates during practice, so it becomes this Catch 22 where I'm afraid of losing during practice but I'm not getting any better because I don't go to class.

-I want to become fitter and stronger from it. But over-exertion can severely damage my 38 year old body. It's common for people to take a break from or drop out of Jiu Jitsu due to injury, and I've had many chronic health problems from it, which I've healed via rest and which adds to the problem of not going to class (I might get hurt, nag an old injury, or maybe I should wait another day and rest up).

Those are three motivations I've listed, along with complimentary demotivations. Are there any exercise worksheets out there I could use to outline all those things I listed and more, so I can break down what it is I love and hate about Jiu Jitsu, in order to help me overcome my demotivation? I could really use it right now.

**Please note: I'm not really looking for comments that contain motivational advice, but thank you in advance.** A few motivational sentences will not purge this ghost that's haunting my House of Jiu Jitsu because I've tried all that before. What I really want is an exercise I can apply to my interest and disinterest to break it all down, look at what I love, look at what I hate, and draw out the ghost, so I can trap it or free it. Is there anything out there?

Well, in the end, after reading carefully the replies and evaluating what to do, I didn't tell them. Two days ago I wasn't feeling well, due to a cardiac disturb - nothing serious or life-threatening, but quite debilitating -, but I did my part of the job anyway. I messed it up. One of them got angry and kicked me out of the group.  
I'll also add that it's *not* because I am not capable to do what we do,  one even said I may be the best out of the three. 

The absurd thing is, in general: If I say I'm having a heart problem - which as I said I often do -, everybody's like ""Oh, don't worry, take it easy, rest, get well soon..."" ... if it's because of anxiety or depression - which are, as we know, **illnesses** just the same, and actually rn I'm much more at risk of dying because of depression than due to my cardialogical problems - it's simply ""Snap out of it.""

I love gaming, and my favourite game right now is LoL, but as of late, no game cheers me up, nothing cheers me up actually. My friends invite me to go out with them, I accept usually, but I never really want to go. I spend hours on my computer doing nothing, because I don't know what to do. I don't feel anything. This has been happening for a while, but I didn't give it much thought until yesterday, when my crush said she wasn't interested in me, and I literally felt nothing. The whole situation was indifferent to me. I'm supposed to feel sad, heartbroken, something, not be like this and feel nothing. Are these signs of depression? I feel tired all the time, I don't have trouble sleeping and I haven't had suicidal thoughts yet. Any help?

(Also I don't study much, but that's a procrastination issue, don't think they're related issues)

They were recently going to divorce and a lot of baggage came out, a lot that really hurt. It was hard to forget it now that I'm older and it solidified a lot of the things I forgot or was suspicious of. It was hard to talk to them again when they decided to stay together.

She clearly has mental health problems that she has self medicated for and my dad is an enabler of the bad behavior which he sometimes joined in on including his own outbursts and physical and emotional abuse.

I have decided to limit my interaction with them due to several therapists and doctors telling me it is the healthier route, given I'm recovering and am being treated for c-ptsd, OCD, and panic disorder.

Well my birthday is on Monday. I decided a harmless dinner would be alright. I sent them an invite on Facebook a month in advance. This past week I've been getting calls that the 20 minute drive to my place and then to the restaurant is a hassle or they don't have anyone to watch the dogs etc... easy shit to coordinate at 50 years old... so I move the dinner around and try to make it to where everyone is happy, without jeopardizing my birthday plans and having an ok time.

I contacted them today, the dinner is tomorrow night. My mom is sick, my dad is sick, my sister's children are sick.... so I cancelled. They argued that they wanted to come but if they are sick I don't want to get sick and don't want them to come out just to prove a point.

I feel bad for making a rational decision. Because I know that a conversation about my mental illness and me being the family weirdo is happening right about now. I don't know why they can make me feel so bad with even such a small amount of communication. I don't know if I did the right thing.

If you heard of crazy people who don't handle being abandoned very well, that's me right now. I am aware what I am doing is wrong, but I just cannot stop. Recently I made a mistake (because of my mental condition) and my best friend ended friendship with me.

She always meant a lot to me. I always trusted her with everything. She was very close to me. I also had strong feelings for her. But dating her was not most important for me. But she was as important to me as my family and since she have left me, I am very very upset. For 10-15 days I was so upset as if someone close to me have died. I still think about her whole day and even in night... every single night.. whole night. believe me she meant a lot to me. I used to care a lot about her when we were friends. I did everything I could to make her happy. And we were friends for like 3 years. She was my only good friend. And every time I used to receive a message from her, I always used to get a big smile.

Now I made a mistake (insulted her too harshly in a text message while I was drunk and angry over her for a fight I had with her) and she have ended friendship altogether. And since then I am going crazy. I just cannot let her go. She was very kind to me and always supported me. And I feel very empty without her. If it was someone else, believe me I wouldn't care much. But not her. She mean so much to me. I am begging to her for forgiveness since then everyday all the time. I just cannot focus on anything. I cannot work or function properly since then. It's been more than a month.

I tried everything to give up. I even once send her very rude message intentionally and then blocked her from everything and deleted all her contact details. I thought after behaving so rudely with her, I will have not courage to reach to her. But after 10 days, I again couldn't stop myself. I recovered her contact details and reached her again. I am again begging for forgiveness to her since then.

We used Viber to chat. She have blocked me so many times because she don't want to hear from me. but i again create a new account with a different phone number just so i can reach to her. Everytime I message her, she just reply with ""leave me alone"" and then block me. I want to leave her alone but I just cannot stop. I desperately want another chance from her. I have broke her trust and I want to earn it again.

It was my fault I insulted her. But I was very upset that night. I also had lot of mental health problem because of loneliness and some childhood problems. That's why I said those things to her. Honestly I can never say such things to anyone in sane condition. Since I had fight with her, I am getting crazy. I have told her everything about my past life just so I can get some understanding from her. I have not lied to her about anything, but still she don't believe me. She probably thinks I am lying or something just so I can get sympathy and forgiveness from her. I have broken her trust, and now she don't want to believe anything I say.

Everyday I try to explain to her it is a big misunderstanding. But she don't want to believe me. I am getting crazy everyday. I am even having health problems because of that. I had constant headache all the time. I keep thinking about her all the time. I feel so out of breath when I think about her. I cannot sleep. Sometime I feel very cold and my whole body start shivering. Sometime I feel like I have fever. I have told her all about my health condition but I don't know. I think she don't believe anything I say anymore.

I am desperately asking for a second chance from her everyday. Nothing is working. She don't want to listen to me. I want to give up, but my brain is just not giving up. And I am behaving like a crazy psycho. Luckily I am not stalking her or something. But I am asking for forgiveness from her every single day. She have requested me so many times to leave her alone, but I just cannot do it. I desperately want second chance. I have promised I will never make mistake ever again and she can leave me alone if I ever make even small mistake in future. But nothing is working and I am getting crazy. Again as I said I wouldn't care so much if it was someone else. She meant so much too me and I cared a lot about her like a family. How will you react if make a mistake and your parent disown you. That's how I feel right now. She is like a family to me and how can I just let her go.

I am also thinking of visiting her soon so I can talk to her in person and can apologize to her. Maybe in real life, she will see my situation is very miserable and will forgive me.

I grew up with a narcissistic mother and abusive/alcoholic father and following unhealthy relationships and other obstacles, i consciously opted out of suicide a few years back. But still, the sole act of living and getting by seems infinitely harder and heavier to me than to others and i don't even know if reaching out to therapy or medical treatment would help in any way or if it would just make me talk and find tricks to get by while carrying the extra weight forever anyway.

I don't always have these feelings, they just come on randomly. Say, sometimes i'd accidently touch the counter with my left hand. I'll want to then touch the counter with my right hand to feel 'even'. I'll do this if i'm adjusting my glasses or accidently kicked something. It isn't all the time. But, I don't have a problem with holding my phone in one hand and using it, or a TV remote, that doesn't feel weird to me. 

Whenever i'm home alone and leave the house, I sometimes check multiple times if I turned off the stove, locked the door, stuff like that. Even if I know I turned it off, i'll always check again. I always hate leaving my phone or laptop charging overnight because of worry it'll catch fire (i'll only leave it charging if it's plugged into a powerstrip with a surge protector). 

In my kitchen the radio, oven and microwave are all next to each other against the same wall, and they all have digital clocks. When i'm leaving, or just hanging in the kitchen, if I look at the radio clock on the right, i'll want to look at the other two to feel 'even'. I'll do this before leaving the house sometimes because if I don't, something might happen. But if I just look at the oven clock, I don't need to look at the other ones because it's the one in the middle so it's already 'even'. 

As a kid, when my mom baked holiday cookies she would keep them in the garage because there was more room out there to store things, and I never liked to eat them because I thought someone could come in and poison them because the door to the garage would only sometimes be locked, so anyone could have theoretically came in and tampered with them. I grew out of that though and I stopped worrying about that as I got older. 

I know I have some Obsessive and Compulsive tendencies an behaviors, but all of the readings i've looked at say that it has to have a large negative impact your quality of living/hinders how you go about your day to qualify as OCD. I don't miss out on things  in life because of these feelings though. Sometimes i'll feel uneasy when going about my day in certain situations when I don't do what I feel I need to do (that has to do more with my general anxiety I think) but after a while I just forget about it and I see that nothing bad happened, so I guess that's kind of like doing your own behavioral-exposure therapy. 

So I guess, what i'm asking is that is there a point in going to see a therapist if these feelings aren't negatively impacting your life and you're managing?",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,Can you have OCD tendencies without having the disorder?

Like some bi people (I'm a 19yr old girl), I find that my sexuality ""ebbs and flows"", as in, it's centred on whichever special person that I find attractive at that particular time, not really anything to do with random people, so it doesn't feel like I have ""general attraction to both guys and girls"".And, because I have BPD, I have a shifting sense of identity AND i fall into really intense, deep infatuations. This means that at times I feel 100% lesbian and at times I feel 100% straight, depending on if I like a girl or guy. This in itself is fine and sexuality can be fluid, but I'm not a mentally ""normal"" person who can think, ""hey, I'm bisexual but I like a guy right now""..for me, my current feelings always COMPLETELY fill my identity, and seem to carry a lot of pain and sentimental significance to me.


I had a few months where I thought I was a lesbian and convinced myself that I'd never been attracted to guys and that ""this"" was the True Me, just because I was crushing on ONE girl at that point. This was extremely difficult for me, since I'm still not overly happy with not being str8, so instead of dealing with being bi, which I AM an have always been, I was suddenly ""aware"" that I was gay and ""had always been gay"", just based on the strong feelings I had then. This BPD stuff is crazy.. my identity suddenly became ""closet lesbian"" to me and I spend 2hrs crying every day about how I'd have to deal with it... all because I liked one girl during those months.

A few months down the line, I fell hardcore for a guy and honestly, genuinely believed ""I'm straight now, thank god, this is easier!!!"""". I KNEW that, logically, I had previously liked girls AND guys in this intense way, so I was bi ""by definition"", but  the single crush I had on this guy felt **so strong to me at the time that I just dumped my old identity**. Instead, the identity of ""straight girl"" consumed me and became all that I related to. This is my issue..  my life is a constant stream of being deeply affected by crazily intense emotions, and feeling like they are showing me the ""true me"" bc they are SO strong that they must mean something profound.

I was just wondering whether any of you can relate to any of this super-convincing, emotional insanity, especially to do with something already-confusing and quite fluid like bisexuality? When I type stuff out, I realise how much BPD affects me. I feel like I live my life in intense, almost drug-experience-like chapters. Sexuality-based examples are particularly crazy, e.g. four months of ""I'm gay, have never even liked a guy"""" back to ""I'm straight, I don't relate to LGBT people at all!!!"". 

It also fascinates me bc I love psychology. I think it's just that we feel more emotions with every experience, so those emotions wipe out any previous identity we related to, and suddenly we feel that we are ""totally"" a certain way and ""have been this way since childhood"".﻿

This does cause me a lot of issues, though. I look back at the last 5 years of my life, I can clearly split that period of time into distinct, strongly emotional 6ish month ""Phases"". Each phase is v unique and characterised by a particular person I was obsessing over, something I thought about myself etc.

So, are any of you like me?",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,"BPD - constant ""revelations"" about my sexuality that change my whole identity?"

Throughout the years I have been striving to find ways to lessen the symptoms of the two illnesses, but this isn't as easy as it seems.  
I am 22 now and have attempted to die by suicide three times throughout my life.   During my attempts I realized that ending my own life would just hurt my family,  and luckily I was able to prevent my attempts from being successful.  
I have been prescribed Paxil by itself, then Seroquil was added, followed by Ativan, and currently I am only on Effexor.

I have overcome drug addiction in the past year.  I used drugs to cope,  and although they did help me be more productive,  I have learned to be even more productive without the daily use of cocaine. I indulged daily, doing 1+ grams and after two years of this decided to stop to see how my mental health would benefit.  
I have done it several times a month in the past 12 but nowhere near my past daily intake.  It's all about progress, right? 

I felt it was necessary to include information about this struggle because it does impact mental health.  
Since I decided to quit I have found my head to be more clear,  but I still find myself becoming suddenly overwhelmed with despair and hopelessness, tears, and the urge to flee wherever I am or ditch anyone in my presence. I experience this several times a week,  often for no reason or occurring completely out of context.  It does impact my day and what I am able to find the courage to do afterwards.  The duration of these experiences could last ten minutes to a full day.

I often act in a ""I hate you /  don't leave me""  manner toward my partner.  I care about him but my attitude toward him can change momentarily like a light switch, sometimes for no reason. 
This hurts and confuses me as well as it does him. 


These frequent encounters make my days difficult. 
I have tried behaving and thinking positively,  meditation,  counseling,   and drastic lifestyle changes when I have a lot of these episodes close together ( multiple times daily,  for a month or more). 

I don't know what genuine happiness feels like.  I am numb or I am deeply sad. I isolate myself from others because I don't like my friends to see this happen to me so often.  My parents have called me spoiled because I do not express my joy for their efforts, although I tell them how much I appreciate everything they do. I could win the lottery and react with  ""that's cool"". 

I attend one session a week with a therapist who uses the cognitive behavioral approach in her practice. I am comfortable with her and I complete the activities she suggests. Hopefully CBT will pay off,  this is my 6th week. 

I live in Newfoundland and the health care system is lacking the attention and proper needs for those who are battling with mental illness.   I have thought about admitting myself to the hospital several times because I feel I just cannot make it through another day. 
Several times I have contributed GPs and mental health professionals about this and they simply upped the dose of whatever medication I was on. 
They've treated me as an individual who has no problems or concerns besides addiction, and tell me I have to ""do this""  for myself,  and sent me on my way,  with no further help.  
They look down upon you if you are open about addiction. 
My cries for help have been ignored.  Employers do not treat you the same if you need time off due to mental illness. Doctors will prescribe you anything just to make a pay cheque and see more patients in a day than listen and properly care for your needs.

This is my first post on reddit and this is how I chose to introduce myself and create awareness for mental health needs in Newfoundland.

So I have a loved one who recently (within the last half year or so) started having bad thoughts. She tells me about them and she hates it and wants it to go away. She says she has vivid imaginations of messed up scenarios. She's had these ""visions"" about me before and started crying because she gets freaked out. For example, we were together and there was a box cutter near us. She told me to move it somewhere and not tell her. I asked why, and she told me that a scenario had popped into her head where she hurt me with said box cutter. But she says she knows she'd never do anything like that. She will be 100% normal almost all the time, then randomly she will imagine some messed up thing that she sees herself doing, yet knows she would never actually do it. She has read about mental institutions and rehab, but does not want to ""lock herself away"" but she says she will if she has to. She is always asking me how she can stop, and I don't know what to say. I know her like the back of my hand and I know she isn't capable of doing any of these things. It's just odd how these thoughts randomly started happening.

Like today, she just called and told me she was carrying a knife to another room for work, and was behind someone and just kinda looked and was like ""what if I hurt him with this knife right now?"" but that she knew she would not actually do it. The thoughts just freak her out and seem to make her depressed.

Once I took her to the ER because she wanted me to and it freaked her out, and the doctor there said if he felt like it was necessary, he'd have made some calls already and had her taken somewhere for help. But he did not deem her fit to be put in a mental institution or anything like that, and neither do I. Sorry this is kinda rambling, but I just figured I'd see if any of you would have any advice.

It got me thinking that I don't just defy traits, I don't even have the core characteristics of ASDs. 

So I sat there are examined my empathy and I realised I always thought I was really sympathetic, but as I examined how I reacted to situations I appeared to have a deficit in this regard but a excess of cognitive empathy, I can read people really well and almost all my responses are faked appropriate responses. The explanation for this is quite sinister I believe! However, I have gone one step further and convinced myself that my responses are real responses, I actually don't really care. 

I actually always considered that I might have bpd, but I recognize that's a scary diagnosis. I'm emotionally volatile, but oddly shallow too, like a tennis ball, nothing on the inside. I have frankly ridiculous relationships with people, from one extreme to the other in a sentence I could go from I love you to I hate you and change my mind again, I have ruined friendships and relationships because of this. I also really like emotionally unstable women too, I have like a sixth sense for it, which I'm only half aware of. So codependency issues too. I've self-harmed although I'm not sure if I did it for ""genuine"" reasons or to just get off on it. (And I consider myself a sadist! Haha. Sex:sadism. daily life:masochism) I experienced auditory hallucinations etc when I have had a breakdown in the past. So I'm more textbook bpd, then textbook ASD. Childhood trauma is the key here, I was normal beforehand, I was diagnosed late with asd after the fact so the aetiology is completely blurred.

However, I'm not either am I? I don't feel the same degree of anxiety, my identity does change but my ambition doesn't, I am very high functioning, I am very self-aware of the parts of me that I allow myself to be self-aware of, and the bits I'm not I hunt down, mercilessly. I enjoy manipulating people, I am entirely Machiavellian, I even lie to myself about why I do things so I sound nicer in order to motivate me not to change my behaviour. I remember I don't quite ever ask for forgiveness due to guilt but due to keeping people around. I've only really ever formed one attachment to someone I know this because they genuinely make me upset. Oh and I am a sadist, and it scares them away, and she's the only one I won't lie to, so I can't tell her I'm not, because frankly I can't trust myself to put myself in a position where she falsely trusts me on false pretenses it isn't fair for her and could be dangerous for her too, so I try not to talk to her anymore. I always felt hmm redeemed(?) with her.

I frankly use my family parasitically, I feel no attachment to them. Like I should but I just, it Isn't quite there. I mean I like my dog, that's something, I was crying the other day over the thought of their eventual death, I have to be there I can't leave them alone not for an instant, even tearing up now! 

I'm a mixed bag but I am reluctant to get diagnosed with all of this, because I have a clock over my head. Suicide is stupid, I'm a nihilist I believe in meaninglessness, so life is just as meaninglessness as not being alive. Suicide is a null answer to an unanswerable problem. However, despite this I need to reach a position of power/responsibility by my mid 30s if I don't then I simply don't see the point of living, I have nothing else to live for. Being diagnosed with a detrimental label therefore could be fatal.

Maybe I'm avoiding pain, by pretending I can't feel it or something like that.

I have never told anyone about the time I stalked a woman, not even my psychiatrist. I don't know if it had anything to do with being Bipolar, or if it was something completely different. All I know is that I'm quite positive I was having a mixed episode at the time.

I have suffered from what I believe to be ""Obsessive Love"" I think since the first time I ever felt feelings for a girl. This one woman in particular was my first I've stalked, and hopefully the last.

I have felt obsessive love with girls since then of course, but have held back from pursuing them in anyways. I have managed to keep it to only friendly chitchat.

Anyways, the woman I stalked was someone I haven't been in contact with for many years. I stalked her on facebook, and I stalked her with a fake account (not pretending to be any specific person, just a made up name with no photo). Yes, I know some people don't see that as ""real"" stalking, but I can assure you I went way too far. I was messaging her not stop, professing my love for her. I was extremely delusional at the time, some how I convinced myself that I could possibly win her heart this way and eventually tell her who I was. I became so obsessive and she told me countless of time to leave her alone and she shut me down hard, which I obviously deserved. I was not accepting this, and I continued to harass her, and I began harassing her family and friends, letting them know just how madly in love I was with her. I just couldn't contain these f**ked up emotions I was having at the time. I had intense adrenaline every time I was contacting her, or her friends and family. It was like I was high. No joke, I have done cocaine a few times in my life, and this felt just like somewhat crappy cocaine, but still most definitely made you high. 

Anyways, this went on for nearly a month until she finally contacted the police. She printed off everything I wrote to her and had her friends and family send the messages they received to her as well. I don't entirely know what happened in the end. All I know is that this scared me so much that I shut down the account and never contacted her again. I'm not sure if the police found my IP address or not. All I know is that she removed me from my real facebook shortly afterwards; however, she did not block me. So I don't know for sure if she found out who it was, or if she was just removing guys she didn't know very well from or hasn't been in contact with for a long time off of her facebook.

I know that she has bumped into two of my siblings quite recently at different times, and I'm extremely paranoid that she does in fact know, and that she told them, and they are keeping it to themselves but think I'm a f**ked up individual.

I want to make clear, that although I still have paranoia about people knowing that I did this, this is not the reason for my intense guilt. I do not think about this all the time, but every now and then I start thinking about it and can't get it out of my head for days. I've always been really hard on myself, so I wonder if that's why I can't forgive myself and move on and strive to be a better person.

An additional note, I do take full responsibility for my actions, and I do not blame my bipolar disorder, or possible other mental health issues, although I think they undeniably played a fairly big role, but I am an adult and I ultimately made the choice to engage in this despicably creepy behavior. 

When I find my mental state to be quite well, I find that I'm quite a laid back, friendly, and reflective. I don't think anyone would be able to fathom that I could do such a thing. Unfortunately it's like there are two sides of me, and I really want to kill the devil inside me.  

On I final note, this incident happened nearly 5 years ago, and like I said, I haven't done anything on this level since. The only two incidences I have had since have been drunkenly texting a couple girls that I had strong feelings for them, even though both of these girls I hadn't actually know for very long. I got along great with both of them, but one was in a relationship and the other just wanted to be friends. These texts didn't really come off as creepy and both of them were kind of flattered, but I recognize that I'm definitely still dealing with some underlining problems. I have completely decided that I will no longer pursue women anymore, because I clearly have issues, and even if I did manage to win a girls heart, I don't think I'm capable of having a healthy relationship. I think I need to eventually tell my psychiatrist, because this may have a huge impact on how he goes about dealing with my mental health, and maybe, just maybe I can get proper help for my problem. Until then I will remain celibate, and suppress my feelings for any woman.",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,I was a stalker and will forever be tormented about my past.

I graduated from high school with 97%, with the goal of doing medical school. Then I went to UofT, ended with something like a cGPA of 3.45. Decided to do a fifth year but at around this time I started to get major doubt, anxiety and negative thoughts. This had begun in small instances before but never to this extent, when I would see a doctor about this they would simply try to give me drugs and said you can overcome this and it was simple to get over. I took that year off. Afterwards I did a Masters in epi and biostats, to boost my CV for med, but instead I fell for weed and alcohol, and finished my thesis in 3.5 years instead of 2 years. After when I graduated, I was super low and fell into this mobile game and wasted 16k in one month, major debt. I worked my ass of as a security guard to pay it off. This takes me to about roughly right now. 
I have no idea what to do and the doctors simple just give me anti-anxiety pills, which just numb me however don't really fix anything. I tried meditation and excerse which work the best, but every time I get better, something happens to me, like the latest thing that happened when things were going my way was an awful accident. This further brings me into negative thoughts and doubt. Now why I don't work in my field that I did my masters is because I never paid attention and I don't like the field. 

I can go on and on, but basically, I don't know what to do. I cant get motivated for long and I get anxiety when I have to focus and run away as a solution and don't get anywhere. What could be my problem, I was so much more when I was younger and now I can't seem to do anything. ",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,Mental health issues that can't be figured out.

I know very little about how to treat bipolar other than what hasn't worked for me in the past. I'm a bad patient who doesn't read the journals or keep up with the latest drugs and dosing.

Using a throwaway because i don't want anyone i know finding this.

For the last 6.5 years I've had severe mental health issues, which are only getting worse every year. To not go into too much detail, it's symptoms of Psychotic Depression and Schizophrenia. I was diagnosed last year with social anxiety and intrusive thoughts, however my therapist was of no use and was set on this being my diagnosis due to me needing to be discharged in the next 4 months because of my age. As well as the thoughts which I refer to as voices because it's more external sounds rather than thoughts in my head, I suffer hallucinating and extreme paranoia. I often blackout when my mood drops so low and can't remember what happened. I've been selfharming for almost as long as I've had these issues, but have stopped and started a lot. I made it almost 2 years before relapsing and that was due to a bad relationship. 
The guy went on to abuse and blackmail me for a few months before leaving. Ive also been in another abusive relationship 3 years ago but i still am affected by what he done. Anyway, lately i've been getting worse again. I've had 2 relationships fail in this year one of which was with the abusive guy, i ended up getting attached to him again and thinking i need him so I'm afraid to lose him again. I'm severely underweight and unable to eat which is making me lose more weight, and when i do eat i still don't put weight on. My depression and other issues are getting worse and I've already started thinking about suicide again, even if I'd not actually go through with it. I have attachment issues ontop of everything which makes it difficult for me to let people go. All of this just piles on and I've been hit really hard with it recently after breaking up with that guy again and him moving on the next day, it makes me think he's just done what he did last year again. 
I'm considering going back to the doctor so I'm able to get help again but i have no idea how to get the help i need, I've seen two therapists and now i just want to be medicated or maybe even put in hospital so I'm able to start recovery for good. 
Sorry for the wall of text and bad layout im posting this from my phone. Any help and advice would be appreciated, at this point I'm seeing no way to actually get better from all of this as it's all i can remember.",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,Getting help

I made an account today because I don't know where to turn. If I seek out help for my mental health issues I may compromise my employment. 

I've been diagnosed with OCD, Anxiety and Depression. This was many years ago when I was about 9. I took medication for the years that followed but it only changed me for the worst. Some medications made me hallucinate, some made me think I was someone I wasn't. Some made me behave and do things I hate myself for now. At 9 I told a school social worker that I wanted to kill myself, that was the first ER trip. When I was 16 a phycologist sent me to the ER again after I told my parents he'd been condoning my defiance of them (which he was.) Long story short I had become a compulsive liar through medication, it destroyed my moral compass. My parents believed the doctor when he sent me back to hell. 

Those ER experiences were traumatizing to me. Its something I've buried within myself. Part of me will never forgive my parents. My dreams of becoming a Soldier, gone. I live a life I shouldn't have lived now. I wanted to serve my country like the warriors of old, but out of fear I didn't sign up. I couldn't reveal my past, it was too painful and destructive. Now I live a life of mediocrity.

I have no joy in life. For almost a decade since my last ER visit I've never found any lasting peace. Whenever I'm on break from work I stay at home for weeks on end, never leaving the house even once. I won't shower for a week, haven't brushed my teeth in months and refuse to shave. I dont exercise. The urge to talk to friends is near 0. 

I thought I had a purpose in life as a child. Every day was a mission. Now, I think about death, and how none of this is worth it if I will cease to exist one day. Why struggle, why have motivation, why exercise, why pursue dreams if it will all end one day? Why get that raise? why do well in school? why not die right now, why not meet oblivion now? I'm too afraid to die but tortured by life. 

Ive slept 24 hours before, I'd wake up and find no motivation to do anything. I've become an alcoholic. 

Motivational videos only seem to reinforce my belief that having a routine and being active only delays the inevitable. It is not enough for me to compare life to a book. Why read a novel if it will end? because the journey to that end was worth it, but is it enough for me to grind my whole life just so I can have a final minute of satisfaction? Before being carted away to the same hole on the same doomed world in the same doomed solar system and cosmos? Life can not be a book. Life has to be something of cosmic importance, somthing immortal, but it isn't. I can't live with that. 

I have no passion, no soul, no drive, no mission, nothing. I only have regrets, self hatred for past actions, a constant blanket of fear from my anxiety disorder, and the wish that I simply won't wake up tomorrow. 

Seeking help conventionally would be career suicide. I'm too afraid to tell you who I am out of fear it will hurt me in real life. Its been 10 years without medication or doctors. Both have harmed me. I take medication I lose my well paying job. I am a skilled laborer in debt, I can't do anything else. Whenever I mess up at work or forget simple details from my mental fog, I pretend I'm stupid and clumsy. Its worked for years, but I can't do this anymore. 

My illness affects my health, my habits, my intelligence, and my life. At this rate I'll have dementia by the time I'm 40.

Please, if there is anyone out there that can help me I hope you reply. 
Thank you.

My goal for this post/question is to see if others can relate, what that means in terms of diagnosis, and more importantly: how do you guys manage and cope with this? I am currently in very good therapy and plan to discuss every bit of this with my psychiatrist and therapist. I'm just generally curious, you know?

So I've been experiencing odd symptoms when off my meds or during periods of stress. I will lose sense of time and sleep whenever and wake up whenever. I will also believe weird things like genuinely believing we probably live in the matrix and we don't truly die, that this conscious life isn't truly real. Ive felt the urge to laugh for no reason and ended up giggling out loud, just the once. I felt aware of myself (unlike with dissociation where I'm numb in every sense of the word) but I'm disconnected with my surrounding aka what is going on around me to a certain degree. It is not distressing though. If i was walking around in my apartment and was hit with a very distressed thought or set of thoughts, i suddenly would stop walking and freeze in place for a minute or two. Frozen in whatever position i was in at the time. Not in a PTSD or anxiety type of way, just physically paralyzed and mentally overloaded and weighed down by my thoughts. I eventually kept mentally pushing myself to get myself to move, then eventually did. I also have trouble concentrating during these periods of feeling off, often shofting focus mentally to another topic. I try controlling it when actually interacting with ppl when this happens and it generally goes well. But during these times i normally just dont go outside my apartment. I feel the strong urge and a sense of happiness to stay inside. Sometimes it's sprinkled with a little paranoia of going outside too.

Something else that has been happening more recently as I'm stabily taking my meds is very disturbing, scary, and strange. Ive missed this one guy that i felt like ive known forever. I was i guess in love with him and very comfortable with him. As i was thinking of him, how we would always joke around, i pictured him in my mind sitting close to me. I was imagining a scenario of him being there and joking around. I did not visually see or hear him there. I then almost physically turned my body to his direction as if he were there. Ive also experienced watching shows where something happens in that show snd my mind has been strongly trying to out loud react to the situation as if i was actually in it. Not even traumatic things. While this happens I am very much stuck in my own head, but not in a bad way. More like in an introverted and harmless sort of way if that makes sense. I cant explain it much more than that, it's been the most difficult to explain.

I suffer from ADHD, OCD, Generalized Anxiety Disorder with panic attacks, and Depression. The past two years have been hell for me. My grandmother who I have fought with, been mostly ignored, then started to make up with suddenly passed away within weeks of getting a cancer diagnosis. Shortly after, my parents and brother, who I've always had nearby, moved 10 ish hours away. Then in July my best friend was killed in a car accident, a month later I lost my job to utter bullshit and it took me 4 months to get a new job. I start my new job and feel really confident and for the most part really enjoy my boss and coworkers. I started the job at the end of October/beginning of November so I've been there for several months now. Over that time period, the Assistant General Manager of the property has seemed to have taken great joy in teasing, cajoling, and otherwise attacking my personality, habits, drive, etc. The mental torture from her has resurfaced my already intense anxiety to the point where I now have more issues than I originally did. For me, anxiety has always been either having gastrointestinal distress and/or having a knot in my chest/chest tightness. It's given me headaches and with the OCD I obsess over whatever is upsetting me sending me into an utter spiral of anxiety. Beginning in December, I started having spells of dizziness/faintness, extreme nausea/dry heaving (even if I've eaten recently it's just dry heaving) and overall malaise when I don't even consciously feel anxious or have a worry at the time. In the midst of all of this I've been trying to better myself by losing weight, trying to be more active, trying to get my house cleaned and orderly as bugs keep somehow invading no matter what I do and I've always struggled with cleaning. It's just hard for me. Queue my husband who I've been married to for 3 almost 4 years, dating for 6 and have known for something like 15 years. He deals with his own slew of mental problems but lately has either entirely ignored/not noticed my efforts, put me down for small things (much like the AGM I deal with when I'm NOT home), and blown up at me for the tiniest of things. I get that I'm uppity. I get that anxiety makes me irritable. (And maybe it should be mentioned that libido has all but completely disappeared over the last several years.) Sometimes his general attitude is so negative/hateful/awful that his tone alone can ruin an entire day. I've taken to trying to point out the issue with him before things turn into a fight because it used to work months ago. Anymore, he just instantly sets off anyway. So either I sit and take the verbal abuse or try to calmly point out that he's not being very nice and then he starts a fight but later blames it all on me. It seems I am always at fault. It is always because of MY attitude. Or I have attitude long after he's started a freaking brawl. And then the argument is because of my attitude (that didn't start until later). My cousin/other best friend is basically absentee. She works constantly but last Thursday after being turned down for her going to something with me, she said she was working and then on fb our other cousin's girlfriend was talking about getting pizza with her and others. It's becoming obvious that her always busy and always working tends to be a huge lie. So apparently no one even wants to hang out or talk to me. I have no one. No one to rant to. No one that understands any of it. Even family always give me ""you need to pray"" or ""just calm down"" or ""don't worry so much"" ""don't think about it"" ""don't let it bother you"" as if I just haven't tried hard enough to shut the mental anguish off. And those are the ones who don't just completely pretend these problems are made up. I've searched for forums to get like a pen pal of sorts to just VENT to and talk about mental problems and life and get advice and friendship out of it and I've come up totally empty. I feel so entirely alone. My husband had a nasty attitude all day, I finally say he needs to cool the attitude (we have two kids who he hadn't been very kind to in tone all day) and suddenly he's yelling st me about my attitude and essentially coming off as everything is my fault (though later he'll tell you he's never said anything like that) and I freaking lost it. I exploded. I demanded he give me my car keys so I could go elsewhere. He held the keys away from me (we have two cars, the keychains were hooked around each other), told me I wasn't taking HIS car anywhere (and this is the first time he's ever done that bullshit) and I finally forced him to give me the other keys because the car belongs to my grandmother and is in no way his though we co-own the other vehicle and storm out with angry tears streaming down my face. I started to go to my cousin's thinking I could vent to her but even when I vent to her about the small stuff he does that we easily make up over she condemns him to the worst which isn't exactly what I want to hear. So now I'm sitting in our city park with no one to talk to but myself and desperate for some sort of release of this awful pain.

So throughout my childhood and teenage years, I was nearly a textbook example of Borderline Personality Disorder.

- I went to extreme lengths to avoid abandonment (to the point of lying to a boyfriend to keep him around, or frantically pleading him to stay), and the thought of being left terrified me. I attached myself to cold and, in two cases, abusive men and ignored any potential partners that would've been healthy for me. 

- I was depressed on and off and threatened suicide many times. Although I did feel despair to the point of wanting to die, the threats were cries for attention/help. 

- I was impulsive and did drugs (didn't enjoy them, more so out for peer approval), drank a lot, etc. I hung out with not-so-great people that used me. I feel some of this may exacerbated my extreme moods and behavior. 

- I experienced rapidly changing moods and a lot of angry outbursts brought on by things that might just be a small annoyance to the average person. Also felt a lack of identity, emptiness, constant anxiety, and had trouble functioning in daily life due to the depression and manic episodes.
I'll add that I was sexually assaulted twice during these years and they were full of other high-stress events, but I'm not sure what impact that had.

Anyways, I'm 22 now and I could not be more of a different person than the one I just described. I still get a bit more overwhelmed than the average person does by a breakup (but don't pull any of my old antics), otherwise would consider myself normal. I've maintained good grades in college, I cut bad people out of my life at 18 so no drugs/binge drinking etc, and maybe one or two manic episodes in the past 3 years. I rarely get angry and can communicate pretty well with people now rather than getting into arguments. I've also gone from 3+ panic attacks a week and the highest dose of xanax to experiencing one like twice a year and no need for pills. My family and everyone who's known me says it's like I'm a different person than I was as a teen. 

I have sort of a fear that all my old mental issues may creep back up one day, that they were so severe it couldn't possibly have just gone away. Also I took therapy over the years but never delved very deep, I can't see that having made a huge impact either.

I have a 1 and a half year old and I feel like so far I've been a great mom. We play all day, we read and build things, go outside and just generally have fun together. I don't ever yell and very rarely have to discipline because she's so good. 

Motherhood has been going fairly smoothly but why do I feel so overwhelmed over small things? I feel like I can go from just fine to on the verge of a panic attack if there is too much going on. If she's overly clingy one day and is climbing all over me and won't let me put her down and is constantly all over me I have to take a moment to catch my breath before I scream. It's never gotten to that point yet but inside I feel like I'm going crazy. 

What prompted me to write this post is we were just in bed and she was laying all on top of me and my husband was laying next to me hugging my arm and we had covers on and I felt like I couldn't move or breath. I had to get both of them off and step outside for a minute just to catch my breath. 

I've always been somewhat claustrophobic but this level of intensity is new to me and I feel like a bad mom and wife that I can't just lay in bed with my family if they're holding onto me.

I have been having for years now this.. ""delusion"" (if it is that, I really don't know) that everyone hates me. But It's weird I use to think that it was social anxiety but the truth is that I am really sociable and love being around people, going to parties and talking to strangers is easy as hell for me, no sweaty palms or anxiety attack, I don't get that feeling that they are judging me at least at first. But paranoia maybe seems... to extreme.

It's already happened multiple times but everytime I start getting close to a group of friends I start getting paranoid or anxious that they are starting to hate me, that i'm annoying them, that they are probably talking behind my back and they don't want me there. 

Because of this I start acting really awkward around them and being distant, and even when I try to suppress my feelings and have a good time it comes of as fake that results in them ACTUALLY not liking me. These symptoms ONLY show up in this specific situation. 
This leads to me having a ton of superficial friends and almost no close friends.


Recently I told a new group of friends how I was feeling and they were really startled at my feelings and irrational conclusions, and looked at me like I was crazy. But I felt it so real, I really believed they hated me and were mad at me. And I know that I am generally liked by people! I constantly hear ""I've heard only nice things about you"" and shit! But I still constantly feel like the more people know me they hate me even though I know it's not true!

Why I think that It may be paranoia is that my beliefs about my friends hating me feel so real and strong even though I have all the information to believe otherwise to the point were I don't trust my judgement anymore. And every little stupid shit I see I will go nuts making ridiculous conclusions about how that totally says they hate me, I'm starting to be annoying. 

I've never read about a ""selective"" SAD in certain situations, I don't know whats going on.

 	My name is OQGA, and I have a mental problem. 3 years ago I entered college and finally had my first relationship. When I was little I was teased for having a crush and I have had anxiety about sharing feeling for a girl. After many no’s a girl finally said yes. First couple months were great it filled a void I look back at those pictures sometimes and seeing my smile is odd now. She broke up with me after mentally abusing me for months. Cheating on me multiple times, having sex with people behind my back. I had to lie to hang out with family and I pushed my friends away. I stayed with her because at the time I denied any evidence of her cheating. Anything that was wrong I apologized for looking back it wasn’t my fault. She would abuse me mentally by saying things after we broke up for months making me think we would get back together. A couple years have since passed and I still have a small box of everything she gave me. I open it up from time to time to smile and think back of when I was happy and read a note she gave me. Each time I open it I write a note to myself that I read each time telling me to be strong and move forward. 
	
Last year I met this girl, finally tried to be happy again. We went out a couple times but every time we went out I couldn't look her in the eyes because I am terrified. I am scared of rejection, and now have giant trust issues. So when I finally asked her to be my girl friend and move things along she said that because she was changing schools she didn't believe it was a good idea. So since she moved to upstate for college we snap every day. I visited a couple times and we went out to dinner and I finally overcame my eye contact thing and started feeling a little more comfortable. But after a while every time I tried to make plans to come up or when I was up visiting other people she is always super busy with unexpected occurrences. But I was still hoping things would get better but recently its just been dry conversations between the two of us. After she moved originally I started to be friendly with my mom’s friend’s daughter. Lets call her Jane. We first hung out at this halloween party. Her ex was there (she ran away from home with him he treated her lie crap the whole time and they broke up) and he kept causing static with me. But I was the bigger man and let it go(I am 6 foot 2, blackbelt so I can hold my own but I don't go around wanting trouble I want peace). Well so one and so forth we would hang out go go to the gun range have fun then she would disappear for a while and not reply to me or anything. Then after a while she would reply to me and we would hang out some more. But every time we hang out she would talk about her ex and it killed me but I listened. So eventually I told her how I felt and she didn't want to date anyone considering it just ruins everything and I respected that. So then after a while she disappeared again. Then reappeared and we hung out dressed as cop and robber (I was robber) last year for halloween and we went out and had a blast. Every time we hang out it feels great except when she talks abut her ex. So she disappeared again except this time she would reply to me sometimes and when making plans they would always fall through. (All this is going on she isn’t dating anyone cause her facebook stays single and her mom loves me and talks to me all the time randomly.) So in the new year I asked her again if she felt the same way about me and she gave me the same response. Well couple weeks ago she actually messaged me first (which usually never happens) and wanted to hang out so we did we had a blast stayed out till 2 am. We took a picture together. Looking at it the next day I realized something. I have the same smile I had way back when it feels right again I am happy. So we hang out pretty much every other day after we hang out she messages me she had a blast and cant wait to hang out again. And this time she hasn’t mentioned her ex at all. Until today except this time it was the ex before the last ex lets call him John. John was physically abusive. Today I helped her take a fridge out of her new apartment and helped her put things in and helped out for a while. When I was leaving she had to run to the store to pick up some stuff I asked if she wanted me to join. She said no because she has to run to her parents house to pick up some stuff and John was supposed to call her. I said what and scratched my head and she got a little defensive (I try not to push her away because I really like her. So I try to not to over step myself because after all we aren't dating. But that doesn’t mean I don't want to punch every guy that hits on her. Most recently was St. Patty's day the foreign exchange student from Belgium was hitting on her and I tried to run interference and eventually he got the hint and left us alone. (also I posted pictures off us to facebook and stuff something I try not to do in case I make girl upstate mad in the small case she is actually wanting to date which she did end up liking and we snap chatted a couple times today like normal) any way I said oh like it was normal and she relaxed again as deep down I was about to die because a couple days ago she said she had an important phone cal at 8:15 and we would hang out after. When I asked her about it at the time she said yea it went well (the phone call) But tonight she said he’s been calling every night at 8:15 talking about stuff (idk what). Then got her car and told that she should be getting her tv set up for movie nights soon for us, and then she left. After we hang out she hugs me and tells me to text her when I get home safe and I tell her the same but this time she didn’t.

Hi all, I was asked to talk about my experiences with self-harm and my subsequent recovery.

My hope is that by sharing some of my lowest moments, people will begin to understand why self-harming occurs and how we can help ourselves and others to recover from it.

By starting a dialogue, hopefully we can help to remove some of the stigma that is holding people back from talking and thus from receiving help.

I must emphasize the trigger warning, this is a very intense read and may be triggering for some people, so please don’t approach this piece lightly.

New_Wave_Nights,False,False,1489989175,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/60euv2/why_do_i_always_begin_to_feel_my_friends_conspire/,60euv2,True,1,False,1492428961,11,"As I've gotten into my early twenties, I've come to realize I have a bad habit that has persisted since at least my late middle school years, and that is to believe my friends conspire against me. 

Without delving into details regarding my current situation (unless it becomes necessary for me to do so), I feel as if some of my friends are conspiring against me in order to keep me from doing a specific action, to keep information from me, or to keep me from getting what I want. I've felt like this in previous situations with varying groups of friends over the years, but they all arise in a similar fashion. Here's how it usually goes down:

1. I tell a friend personal/ private information, usually regarding a woman I may have an interest in , or something I feel about a friend. 

2. Said friend and I may discuss whatever I told him/her a few more times, and as he offers his thoughts, to which I'm accepting of hearing, but I draw boundaries that I oftentimes do not want the friend to actively involve themselves in the situation. 

3. I begin to (unconsciously?) scrutinize and analyze the relationship between my friend and whomever I discussed with him. I often end up finding myself looking for hints that he's revealed my secret or has ulterior motives.

4. I end up growing immensely suspicious of both my friend and the individual I spoke to said friend about. For example, if it's a woman, I begin to read into situations involving them both too deeply. 

5. I can't get the idea of my friend betraying me and/or things going immensely wrong out of my head and it is all I think about. 

One situation from when I was 17 best exemplifies my struggle here: I told a friend that I liked a girl, and it turned out he also liked the same girl as well ( I never knew until much later). One night, the friend, the girl, and a few other members of our friend group did not reply to texts for the entire evening, leading me to think two very far-fetched ideas:

1. The friend whom I told my secret and the girl I like must have gotten their phones taken away for sexting, because I *thought* one time that I saw a picture of breasts on my friend's phone, therefore I figured he would be inclined to compel the girl to send him topless photos. 

2. Everyone was not answering my texts because they were out having fun without me because they all felt compelled to keep me away from seeing my friend I spilled gossip to and the girl I had a crush on because they supported a relationship between them more than between the girl and myself. 

I recall, that evening, I sat journalling my fears for at least two hours. I also recall that during Skype calls with my group of friends, any conversation  involving the friend I told a secret to and whoever was the subject of the secret, I would convince myself that they were speaking in some sort of code or dropped certain phrases that only they and a select few understood in order to keep me out of the loop. 


Luckily for 17 year old me, neither of these were true, and nobody was working against me, despite my gut twisting in a knot and telling me it was so. 

This is something that I do that *seriously* bothers me, and I don't know if it points to a serious mental problem. I've never had a history of mental problems, and neither has my family. I come from a family of confident people, but I know I'm a little more mild and inclined to risk aversion than most of my family.

Essentially, why do I grow immensely suspicious of my friends, then craft grand scenarios of why they may be doing something against me? Is it because my mother told me time and time again throughout my youth to be wary of who you confide in? I know that's common sense, but how on earth did I take it to the extreme of being an extreme cynic/skeptic? 

**TLDR**: I easily grow skeptical of my friend's intentions and begin to craft grand scenarios in my head as to why they may be working against me or have ulterior motives. What's my deal?",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,Why do I always begin to feel my friends conspire against me when certain social situations arise?

For some background, misophonia is a disorder that causes irrational reactions to certain noises. Lip smacking, loud chewing, coughing, sneezing, and throat clearing are common triggers. Anger and irritation are the most common reactions to these triggers.  

Yes, I am fully aware this is entirely irrational and people can't help making these noises. I can't control it, even though I wish I could.  

Edit: To specify how badly this effects me, I never go in his classroom and almost always opt into doing independent work in his class. I have extreme difficulty forcing myself to have eye contact with him, which is something I haven't experienced with most other people, only strangers.

Does anyone have any advice? Earbuds help a lot, but carrying them around all day usually means they get damaged and one ear stops working. I've gone through two pairs already.",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,Help with misophonia?

I don't think I'm a very anxious person but I definitely have thoughts that bother me, mostly about how I've fucked up so much and how I'm so scared I won't be able to accomplish anything because of it, and because of how I'm so insecure about myself.

Which I don't need pressure or anyone I know knowing about my current situation. Anyways, I think I might have some serious problems upstairs, but I'm afraid to get evaluated. Here are some reasons why:

1. I live with my parents currently but I'm moving out because I have enough money saved up to move to the state I'm going to college in. So I don't know how much it'll cost to get evaluated and if I need it to happen, get help. Which if I spend too much money I'll be slowed down again in my leave.

2. I want to be a fireman so I don't know if whatever I have/if I have anything will affect my chances of doing so. 

3. If my SO found out I have something wrong with me, (which I'm moving in with, we're going to college together) she'd probably tag along everywhere I go, most things I do, even if I was with friends. Which I don't have a problem with spending time with her, it's just she'd be over worried about it and I'd get zero alone time. I'm assuming she'll do this because her dad has schizophrenia and her mother goes with him everywhere. So I figure she'll do the same.

4. Being held back in life due to a label a doctor gave me. (I know this is related to reason 2, basically the same thing, but this worries me the most.)

So I'll list some things I've been experiencing just to see if I'm just being paranoid and don't have to get evaluated at all. Here are some: 

1. When I'm trying to fall asleep I'll talk to friends and people I know that aren't even there like it's normal, and then we I see their face near me I freak the fuck out. I don't know if this is a common phenomena or an issue.

2. I scream all the time in my sleep, and when my mom tries to calm me down I cuss her out and tell her to get away from me. But when I wake up I don't remember any of it, which scares me.

3. Sometimes I can't feel my body when I wake up in the middle of the night, (and I'm not talking about a fucking arm being asleep or a leg, I mean I wake up, fully conscious, and I can't feel my entire body for however long it lasts, it varies.) and it's a truly horrifying experience 

4. Whenever I'm around another male alone in a room or an enclosed space, I panic and need to get away immediately. Doesn't matter who they are. (This is due to a past experience that I do not wish to discuss. Please don't ask about it.)

So what are your thoughts? What do you think I should do? Is there anything wrong with me at all? Am I just too paranoid? Please let me know and thank you for any helpful insight.",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,I think I might have some mental issues and I don't know what to do about it (19m) (USA)

I'm generally a pretty go-with-the-flow, relaxed person (aside from your average occasional, but rare work/school stress). This has affected me to the point that I've had suicidal thoughts for the first time in like, 4 years and relapsed cutting for the first time in 3 as a last resort type thing. I haven't really had this over the course of the last week, but I keep getting what I think are anxiety attacks? Basically I'll be at work/at home and I get this tightness in my chest, lump in my throat, get really antsy and feel like crying, but panic cause I know I can't since I'm in public, so then I start to think a lot really fast and kind of freeze up. It eases up after that but the physical aspect stays for like maybe 20 mins and I get kind of brain dead for a while after. 

So basically, I'm not really a fan of seeing a therapist/don't want to go through the whole process of explaining the background and paying a shit ton of money for it. I have the option of going to my family doctor and getting a script for something, but not really sure what it would be.

I haven't been depressed in a super long time, so I feel like taking a long-term medication might be pointless, but I'm having a really hard time coping with this on my own as I have with previous mental issues.

I started struggling about 2 years ago with jealous delusions (Delusional Disorder). I had previously struggled with anxiety and depression and have a family history of mental illness. I had been working in the mental health field when I started having the parinoia that my boyfriend of 3 years (at the time) was cheating on me. I began blaming him and searching the house for evidence. I felt like a crazy person and was severely damaging my relationship. 

I was already on medication for anxiety and depression and began working with my psychiatrist on trying other medications to help with the delusions, tried several mood stabilizers, anti psychotics, anti depressants, anxiety meds. I did talk therapy for awhile, knew that my brain was always on high alert and my ""worst case scenario thoughts"" are untrue, but the feelings are so strong they consume your life. Thankfully, the feelings come and go but when they hit it is extremely overwhelming and real. 

My boyfriend and I have now been together for over 5 years and he has been so supportive. He has been told by others when he has shared about our struggle with that he deserves better and doesn't deserve to be blamed. I know the thoughts are untrue but when it consumes me it is still difficult to not blame him or talk with him about it. I have since found that no medication helps and currently only take anxiety pills as needed and talk therapy to try to manage the overwhelming thoughts. I now realize that this might be a life long struggle for me. I know it has changed my relationship with my boyfriend significantly and we both wish we could go back to the way things were before the mental illness. 

This disorder seems to be fairly uncommon and I would love to hear from anyone else that has struggled or known anyone that may have had the disorder. I feel blessed that I had the background to know what I was experiencing was untrue and have had such strong support from my boyfriend and family. I will definitely share more if anyone is interested in discussing it further. ",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,My 2 year struggle with jealous delusions

I started seeing a therapist about a year ago since I became an adult.
She always says I am very self aware. 
My diagnoses over the years have changed a lot. 
I've seen more different docs than I can remember, honestly. 
My current diagnosis that I know of is moderate major depression, PTSD, paranoia, ODD, and SAD 
In the past I've also been diagnosed with schizoaffective with underlying bipolar, and mania. 
My mother is schizophrenic with paranoid delusions, so there's that, 
I didn't really know my dad (he died) 
My mom attempts suicide or reaching out for attention, I dont know, she hurts herself every couple of years, and I've stopped caring. She's been waiting to die my entire life and I've already mourned her. For a while I had gone long enough avoiding her, I forgot what her face looked like, it was blissful. Then she came by my house and gave me sweets and new clothes, I took it as some kind of psychological attack, trying to guilt trip me into seeing her. 
Maybe its my age and gender 
But I resent her. She says she tried her best to raise me, but I dont think she should have ever had children. 
Enough of my mama though. 
Its about me for once, just today, 
Even though I think I'm extremely narcissistic, and five points away from a personality disorder, I think purely because I can't be completely honest on tests, because it always changes. 
Everyone I see, that I know, love me. They tell me when I'm hard on myself, 
But even my closest friends and family I don't fully trust and I doubt I have the ability to. 
Right now is a mood, I guess, its hard to tell but sometimes I have moments of clarity and go back and analyze my behavior and reasoning. 
All of my memories are third person, back to ones from when I was a toddler. I find it odd I remember more of my larval stages (haha), than being a tween to even now. I assume its stress and declining mental health, but even in that I can identify for the most part when I'm not being ""normal"" 
I feel like there's a lot of people in my head that fight for the controls, but I am aware of them, personally and otherwise. 
But everyone tells me I'm pure, kindhearted, smart blah blah they dont see my evil. It is indulgent but still sometimes I feel a bit guilty and get sad about it. 
Even when I'm not aware of it I shape those around me to do better in life, I form strong bonds with a select few and make sure they get on the path towards success, to ensure my being able to remain comfortable and entertained. 
I've had family members tell me I could start a cult if I really wanted, and honestly could help with some of my plans, but I find it too much effort for my simple goals. 
I've been suicidal since I was six years old, in the past I refrained because I didn't want people to feel bad, now it is because that expresses the ultimate weakness. 
I have a subconscious obsession with status and feeling superior to my peers and self in ways. 
Sometimes I hear, see and feel things that aren't there, it varies in intensity and symptoms over the years since it began five years ago (noticeably)
Recently its just been whispers, people hunting me, begging for help, being curious of what I'm doing, 
But whenever I catch myself paying attention, the ugh voices notice too. They often come from shadow people I see almost everywhere. ""Can you hear me"" over and over and my eyes follow the sound and I see them ""she can hear me! She sees me"" then it intensifies into a dull roar like a full room of different whispered or screamed conversations. For the most part I know what's real and what is not, but I get mixed up sometimes and those around be get worried. 
I've been on Zoloft again for about two months, it seems to be helping my confidence and such, but I lost the satisfaction in getting stoned, which I know I shouldn't do with my condition, but it butters my brain. 
If you're still reading, I thank you. And as you see I'm talking to you like someone I know, because why not? Isnt it easier to trust a stranger than otherwise? The only ones who do know my username already know most of this, and I dont mind. 
I really dont care about a lot of things pertaining to myself unless it upsets those I care about. Haha, a slave for love. 
Other times I am so self righteous and high and mighty and blah blah blah violent tendencies quelled by years of treatment and counseling. Sometimes I snap, get mad, fracture my hands on a wall or something a bit. Better than hitting a person right? Ive tried the whole punch the pillow thing but I need the impact, the force of the throw contrasted with the solidarity of the object im hitting. 
And again please excuse bad grammar and misused words, I'm a nineteen year old woman who happens to be a high school drop out. 
I dont know what else to say really, 
After typing all this I almost feel like its better suited for no sleep 
But I dont mind 
It just feels nice to type it out 
I'm open to questions and advice. 
Literally ask me anything. 
Why not be an open book if no one can understand you anyway?

Me and my girlfriend have been dating for a few months now and I know she has been suffering with some degree of mental health. I didnt however really understand it or know what it was properly until last night. 

ive experienced mood swings and sometimes agression towards me for no reason but yesterday was the first time in person I experienced her in a very odd state and i need advice on what to do and how to handle and support her.
I Love this girl and i want to help her, but I have no idea how to and i feel very lost. 

She has suffered with a terrible trauma earlier in life, she was sexually assaulted and it wasn't taken seriously by anyone(Throwaway account for various reasons). 

Yesterday I experienced her change, it was pretty sudden, we were talking and laughing one moment and then the next she became really sleepy and not talkative at all, her mood fluctuated between smiling at me to crying to not being able to breath and telling me she is ok. 

I know she hears voices but to what extent I do not know. 

There has been a past of mental issues and she was kicked out of school because of these, aswell as self harm on various occasions. 

Im lost, i dont know what to do, I dont physically feel as though i can do this alone but she doesn't seem to want help as anything she has tried in the past has failed. 

I dont know if this sort of plea is allowed in this sub but I have no idea where to go or who to turn to, I havent spoken to my friends or family about this because most of the time my girlfriend is normal and can enjoy things and I dont want anyone painting a bad picture of her.

I've been on Effexor XR for about a year and a half now for depression and anxiety. I've found that it definitely takes the edge off, but it's completely killed my libido which I find super depressing anyway. I also feel like it has me feeling totally flat, and honestly, I prefer highs and lows to just...nothing.

So I went to my doctor yesterday, told him that Effexor is okay but the effect on my libido is really bothering me and I also wouldn't mind cutting down my dosage as I feel it's a bit much. He said that he'd put me on Buspirone (Buspar), which isn't as heavy-duty and shouldn't have the effect on my libido that Effexor does. He also mentioned that another patient of his went from Effexor to Buspirone recently and was quite happy with it.

What he failed to mention was that Effexor is not easy to quit. He said he wasn't sure of the wash-out period and to ask the chemist when I got my prescription for the new medication, and they didn't have any specific information but said 3-4 days is generally considered the safest. I'm on day two of no Effexor now and I'm dizzy, have a mild headache and generally feel like crap. I've experienced this before when I've run out and it only gets worse from here - cold sweats, headaches, etc. I looked it up on Google and lots of people say that Effexor shouldn't be quit without strict advice from a doctor, and not to go cold turkey. I feel like he really should have given me more advice in terms of switching over.

I'm 25 and been having an extremely hard time focusing on anything lately. I've also been dealing with some anxiety and different thoughts that I can't get rid of - but I'm not entirely sure if it's just me being a hypochondriac or not. I've never seen a doctor, and I don't really talk about personal issues much. I've read up on numerous mental health conditions for hours upon hours, but still can't pin down what I'm feeling. 

I have a feeling the inattentiveness is ADHD that I've never had treated, and I've always had bad anxiety around other people, but I've made it this far without needing treatment. The part that's bothering me the most is a constant feeling/daydream continuously running in the back of my mind where I'm being watched by someone. It sounds worse than it actually is, it's not that I feel persecuted or paranoid, it's more like having an imaginary friend again like in childhood. The daydreams though almost exclusively focus on being saved from something (whether it be a suicide or drug addiction etc, always something dark). I know it's just a daydream, not an actual belief or delusion, but I can't turn it off anymore and can't figure out what it is. It's making me lose hours of my time at work, similar to what maladaptive daydreams sound like.

Im gooing to make up names of my friends to help keep everyone in order and to keep their privacy. 

The setting being me and 4 friends sitting on my friend's , lets call him Jack, back porch hanging out drinking some beer smoking some weed and talking. Of the 4 other people there I am only really close to Chris who is one of my best friends. Chris is good friends with the other 3, Doug and Lewis and Jack. I am not strangers with these guys and we all get along great but I just dont know everyond the way the rest of them do. Doug, Lewis and Jack are VERY tight friends. They spend weeks with each other on backpacking and climbing trips and seem to know everything about each other. 

So the night goes on and we all have a really good time, we stayed up talking until 1am when Doug stood up and said that he needed to leave because he had to work in the morning. Jack, the guys whose house we were at, asked Doug why he was leaving in a very strange accent and weird voice. I didnt think anything of this because I assumed Jack was just being funny and acting stupid. Doug knew this was not the case and turned around quickly and started walking very quickly back towards Jack. 

He was almost screaming at Jack asking him repeatedly, ""Are you high Jack?"" 

Jack started doing some strange things with his face and hands and then kept talking in this strange accent and weird voice. Doug got close to Jack started poking at Doug with a lit cigarette.

 Doug asks, ""can I have a drag of that?"" and Jack gives him the cigarette and Doug starts waving it in his face. 

The entire time Jack is still talking completely different then he usually does and they are just kind of yelling at each other. During this time I was still just assuming they had some inside joke or bit or something they do thats funny and I was laughing. 

But Doug and Lewis started yelling at him asking Jack ""who are you? who are you talking to?"" over and over again. 

At this point I started getting really confused. Lewis briefly explains and says ""Jack has this weird thing where he becomes another person and Doug is really good at talking to it and bringing it out"" 

This seems completely insane to me. If you met these guys you would understand why this is just not a big deal to them. They really believe that Jack has ""an easily manipulated energy"" and that this is just natural energies moving around. I sort of just bought this for a while and still kind of thought they were messing with me. After Doug had tried to talk to this alternate version of Jack, Jack began rubbing his eyes really intensely and then sticking his head in his lap, reached his hands in the air and made a weird moan. He looked up and just kinda sat there. 

Me and Chris looked at each other in complete amazment. I asked them what happened and Lewis  said ""Jack has another being in him that Doug can talk to. There has been multiple occasions in which Jack has become what we call the bush lady. We have found Jack having entire conversations with himself in this voice. He goes off by himself sometimes when they go on trips and just becomes another person for a moment in time. There have been times where Jack has been the ""bush lady"" for hours."" 

I know this sounds completely crazy and I think so too, but as I explained earlier, the reason this is not a huge deal to them is because they are INSANELY CLOSE and they have just rationalized it with their beliefs in natural energies. 

I asked Jack ""Do you remember what just happened?"" and he was confused. 

He said ""Yeah Doug ran at me"" 

I said ""Do you remember talking the way you did for like 10 minutes after that?""
 
He said ""What are you talking about?""

This is when I began to worry that this was some sort of mental health issue. He completely became another person and doesn't remember it at all. He has done this on multiple occasions apparently. 

We eventually left after all this happend, but I havent stopped thinking about what happened.

My boyfriend and me got together a little more than three years ago, and right in the first month I got admitted for two months to a mental institution to get diagnosed. He got into my life when I was at a low. 
I got diagnosed there with GAD with Agoraphobia (that later turned out to be a social anxiety disorder), dependent personality disorder, ptsd and signs of borderline.
He visited me everyday at the mental hospital. He drove me to all my appointments after that, and he held me when I was depressed (and also when I felt good, because he's cuddly like that).
After a year of waiting after me being back from the clinic, I finally was allowed to start my mentalization based therapy for the borderline part. This was a three days a week therapy for 9 months.
My mood swings were almost gone after this therapy, it worked very well for me. However, my anxiety became a lot worse. Because I finally knew how to acknowledge my feelings, I've felt the anxiety way more extreme. I've always felt pretty scared when I heard people vomit, but I managed enough. After my boyfriend got sick one night (stomach flu) in my bedroom in front of the door, my emetophobia went REALLY bad. Whenever anyone has to cough, my heart rate goes way up and I start sweating like crazy. 

I've always had a really low sense of self-worth, and I feel inferior to 90% of the people I meet. 
I have always been submissive to him. But he was so sweet to me I've always loved feeling less than him. It was comfortable. 
But since my emetophobia got so bad, I've tried telling him (in my own, way too subtle way) I really didn't like it when he drank more than 3 to 4 beers when he was with me. I always told him after i felt uncomfortable, because often there were friends around and I always was scared his friends would think I was a whiny weird person.
At first he kept promising he wouldn't drink any more than I felt comfortable with, but he still kept going because I think I was too subtle in telling him. 
After a lot of times of me trying to tell him, after a few crying and telling him I really wanted to be normal, he promised to just stop at four. He didn't. And I felt so awful about containing him in what he could do.
Apart from this, I've been living on my own for about two months now. I'm still scared as hell I won't make it alone, but until a few days ago, I managed.
My boyfriend still lives with his parents, but made his way into my apartment because he really wants to live with me. I don't want to yet, because I think it's important for me to learn how to cope on my own, and for him to learn how householding actually works (he's not learning that at his parents because he couldn't be bothered).
He goes to a place where he can do his work, and the owner of this office is a friend of him too. He goes there in the morning, stops working at five, and then drinks a few beers there until about 7:30 and then heads to my place. 
I've told him over and over again that I was completely okay with being a housemaid, but if I'm expected to make dinner, I don't want to wait that long until he gets home tipsy.
He kept answering that I didn't have to wait for him with cooking because he could heat the meal up again. And that it was not a big deal as I made out of it. And that he should be able to do the things the way he liked.
He didn't get that I didn't like the combination of it all.

So I wrote a letter. 
A big, long letter. 
Saying that I was done with accepting him doing whatever he wanted, and that he should understand how being in a relationship means taking the feelings of your SO into account. 
I told him that I wanted him to consider my feelings, and that if he didn't want to I would be done with us.
I felt so strong and independent at the time.

When he read the letter, he said he didn't know what to say, took his stuff and left.

Very late that night he told me he was so afraid I would hurt myself, and that he had been crying the whole evening. And that he wouldn't have been crying if he didn't love me. He also told me he didn't want to be at my place anymore for nobody knows how long. 
He told me he cared about me, and that he didn't know if there was a solution to this.
We haven't talked after that. This was two days ago.

Yesterday evening a friend of both of us put a video of him and our friends playing with VR racing. I saw him laughing, and I immediately heard the little voice in my head saying: 'he doesn't care about you, he's better of without you, he's glad he doesn't have to be without you anymore'.

Now I'm back at feeling full blown depressed. I've had moments, in the last two years, but they didn't last longer than a few hours. Now I don't think I'm getting out of this anymore. 
I've been in relationships since ten years ago, I've never been alone. I'm so scared he'll be in front of my door in a few days saying he doesn't want to be with me anymore. 
I can't be alone, I really can't.

I finally stood up for myself and now I hate myself for it.",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,On the verge of a break up I think?

It made me feel sorry for myself. Yeah I read about stuff like that on the news murders, torturing and rapes but never could take in what it really was and didn't know what it really was until I saw footage of it. At the time I didn't think people knew that this kind of stuff was really happening.  I tried like pretend to forget about it and like pretend like I never saw it but it obviously made it much worse. I realised later that there was a lot of shit much worse than this on the internet who some people actually enjoy watching and it made me sick. I don't if the video I saw was just some fake porn or real but doesn't really matter does it. 

Like a therapy for myself to remind me about that this is not the only shit that is happening in the world I've seen other rape videos, torturing, assaults and murders much worse than what I saw as a kid. It is still that video I saw when I was 12 that I'm thinking about every day. When these thoughts come up it drags me too deeper thoughts like why did I react like I did, why do I still feel bad about this, could I have done something to make it less emotional painful to me. I get stuck over analysing everything instead of just seeing it as it is. Yeah you should feel bad about it but what more can you do? Like I have seen it already I cannot undo it just accept it. Life is too short to sit and think about bad memories instead of actually do stuff and make something meaningful out of your life.
I didn't tell anyone about it until like 4 years after and it was a relief for sure but it didn't stop the constant thoughts in my head. 

What can I do to find peace with this? Would be really glad for any help. These thought makes me sleep less and can distract myself from studying, working concentrating on something or whatever. I'm seeing a psychiatrist but not for this reason but for suffering from a psychosis. Should I mention this? It is kinda awkward to talk about. I've only talked about it on the internet and family.
Like what do I do when these thoughts and pictures in my head arises. Do I just accept them as they are but no need to follow them to deeper thought or do I need to think these thoughts through. I realise I can't just make these thoughts disappear but how do I manage these in a sensible way. Was my reaction as a kid normal? I was very sensible as a kid and cried and got hurt and upset very easily. I have had seen that video today I would of course have a better understanding of the reality of our world and what is happening but as a kid I had no idea stuff like this was going on and it freaked me out and at that age I thought like do people actually know about this or are they just going on with their happy lives pretending like it doesn't exist.

Today is the worst part. She got super giddy and we were having a good time and when I went to shut off the lights (on her demand) and lay down she lost it, shreaked and held her face saying I was terrifying with no explanation. Then a few minutes later burst into laughter and couldn't even speak (kinda like she was possessed) and then stoped abruptly, asked to check her closet to make sure a man wasn't in there and then curled in bed repeating ""don't hurt me"".

I'm terrified. I imagine it's just stress but I'm at a loss for words. Like an open eye, cognitive nightmare.

And I know that all psychiatric wards are different, but I just kind of want an idea of what it's like to be in a mental hospital in case I need to go. I live in the us. I have depression & anxiety and I'm on medicine (Prozac 40mg) but it doesn't work for me and I've been taking Prozac for 3.5 months. I've been kind of suicidal but I think I'm fine for now. I'd just like to get an idea of what I'm getting into if in the near future I decide I need to go to the ER if I'm suicidal


Again, I know it depends from hospital to hospital and each area but..


If you go to the ER and say you're having suicidal thoughts or want to harm yourself, do they just keep you in the ER or do they take you straight away to the mental area? Or do they evaluate how you feel and either send you home or admit you if they see you as a threat to yourself?


When you're in the actual physiatrist ward, what it's like? Do they have psychological nurses (or whatever they're called) or just regular nurses (I don't know much about medical stuff so idk if all nurses are just the same or if some have a special focus in a certain area). Do they have therapists or psychiatrists or any specific mental health workers?     How long do they keep you there if they admit you? Can you leave if you feel better (and they think you're okay) or do you have to stay a certain amount of time? Do regular hospitals do any kind of treatment or do they just hold you and make sure you don't die? What's the actual ward like..like does it look like a regular hospital, do you have to stay in your room, is there like community areas? The mental stuff is on the top level of my hospital so I've never been there. What type of other patients are there? Again I know this all varies but overall/your experience. 


I've never even been admitted to the hospital or ER for anything. The only times I've been there is to visit people or to get blood work. Just walking into the hospital gives me anxiety. Any new experience I haven't gone through gives me anxiety. I know it's a lot of questions but I'm just curious and need to try to mentally prepare myself and know what I'm getting into in case I need to go. I'm not asking for exact answers, but if any of you guys have gone to the hospital for feeling suicidal, what was your experiences and what was it like for you? Thanks :)


Edit: extra things I thought of lol
Do you share a room typically or do you have your own? Also I assume if you're admitted to the hospital you have to wear the hospital gown thing, right? Or in the mental ward can you stay in your regular clothes? ",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,What's it like to be in a psychiatric ward?

I haven't left the house in over five years and all I would do is browse the internet 24/7. I eventually started joining forums and I discovered that one forum wasn't what I expected at all. The off topic section of that forum was supposed to be about random discussions like food,girls,life problems etc yet all of those guys would talk about is race and religion.

Now, like any sane human being who doesn't like negativity,  I should've left. Idk what it was but I just became extremely addicted to the site and I started to develop hateful views even though I'm one of the most open minded individuals out there.

I absolutely hate that site and what they've turn me into. I have anger outbursts, intrusive memories and much more. The thing is, those guys don't actually interact with the types of people they despise. All they do is sit around making up false stories based off of hearsay.

And because I am like that, I get frustrated and unhappy with myself. Every evening I tell myself ""Tomorrow I'll be productive"" but I never am. I am postponing everything, I can't make myself exercise even though I want to.

I have changed courses and I think it was a great decision after failing miserably in the old university. I'm interested in my new course. After lectures, I feel really motivated to learn more about it, but as soon as I come home and sit down, I lose all interest.

There is SO much I would like to do and achieve, but I'm afraid I never will. It's as if I don't have any energy to do important things. For example, if I go to lectures and cook lunch afterwards, that's it for the day. The rest of the afternoon I'd spend watching TV or Youtube.

To make this post short Im just gonna list the problems i have!

1- Since my childhood i see peoples head much smaller and far away than they really are when there is distance(not much min.30-35cm) between us and i focus on their face it was just the head BUT i think (see the second problem) few weeks ago when i came home and i was pulling off my shoes my mom came and we started to talk about sth(i think it was exams) and when i look at her face it got like i lot more smaller immidieatly and when i looked at the tv(it was on) its frame (not the screen i was sure) started shrink then i stopped looking at it , i was used to heads shrinking for 20-30sec but this one lasted more than a minute plus nearly 30sec. Tv shrink.

2-i lost my sense , perception of time like literally. Not just knowing the day but for ex.: i think of a memory i have or someone tells me about it but i cant know if it was yesterday, last month or last  year sometimes it feels like a really old (definetly not important) ""memory"" happend last week (or vice versa) i literally dont have any perception of time (im having this problem for the last 2 max 3 years i think :/)

3-sometimes i feel like my hands are a lot smaller and mostly thinner like super thin it used to last for few seconds but the ones i had in the last few months(?) lasted for more than 30secs and way more effective than the others (no visual change but via touching them with each other(handception). (This is also a really old problem like the first one)

4-so sometimes i have this thing i call ""Mindfuck"" which fuck ups all of my perceptions , senses etc.(not the five main ,physical, senses) i dont really know a way to describe it all i can say is everything besides my five main physical senses explode like Oppenhemiers first baby (i know who i am and where i am but nothing else especially what fuck is going on) and these used to be nothing more than 10-15 secs but the last one i had in monday evening lasted more than 1,5 mins. It started like the ""ordinary"" ones but then it immideatly got sooo powerful it was like the Uber-Super Saiyan version of the previous ones it was literally the worst experience of my life

5-sometimes everything seems stranger to me including my own body!
for example ; i was walking down the stairs and i felt like the body im in is irrelevant,stranger,like an external case to be honest.

6-sometimes when i sit straight in my desk i feel like my body is moving (might be relevant to the one below) front and back but not moving like walking more like a very very stable shaking but im aware its not moving

7- when i lie down on my arm/s i can feel my pulse very very powerfully and clearly and sometimes i can feel it in my fingers and on the tip of my fingers (not lying down or touching them with other body parts) 

I dont know what to do , i know that first one is Alice in Wonderland syndrome/micropsi , i dont know what these are , i dont use drugs , i have never drinken alcohol, i wasnt dehydrated , hungry/starving, sleepy (i cant sleep idont feel need for it i can only sleep when im bored which is rare especially at night because idea,thought bombings to my concinous mind barely stop) or tired.
What should i do , what are these things , am i fucked?",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,Am I losing my mind?

I feel the need to talk to someone but my mother won't let me. In 2014 I moved from Chicago (where I had been living in since I was two)to Washington. Most of my family is in Chicago and when I heard I was devastated, I didn't get to say goodbye to my friends and I bearly got to say goodbye to my family as my mom wouldn't let me. Ok fast forward to Washington and boy was I anxious, mostly because I was starting high school all alone and I was scared. That summer I spent it in my room. I had and iPod but we didn't have wifi so I couldn't talk to anyone. I felt alone and depressed I would cry myself to sleep sometimes, I really wanted to go home. When school started I threw up twice before going, the school was very small and everyone knew each other so I felt like an outsider. Then a couple of weeks later it changed I had friends I was doing way better. I still missed home but not as much. I was doing good in school and like I said I MADE FRIENDS!! We all became pretty close and I got comfortable there. End of that school year my parents separated and my mom, my sister and I moved to another small town an hour away. Starting school I was nervous but seeing as I made friends in my other I hoped it would be the same here(mind you I'm a very very shy person). It wasn't, nobody would talk to me, now I wasn't being bullied or anything but I just felt depressed again I missed my old friends and I missed Chicago. I started skipping school my mom worked in the mornings so I would just stay home, that school year I think I only went for like 1 full semester. I made a friend there just one but we had fun it felt sooo god to talk to someone else. In that school I got put in algebra again I had already taken algebra twice, in Chicago I was supposed to start taking advanced classes but when I moved I got stuck in algebra again learning things I had already learned. We moved from that town in the summer. And now I'm in a different high school I told my self I would try harder and not miss any school, but as I'm typing this I'm skipping school. I know I should go to school, I don't want to keep doing this to my mom (I think that they'd be better of with me dead). Staying home just seems much better then going to school. If I'm going to be alone I might as well me alone and comfortable at home. There's a lot more to the story but I just needed to put that out there. Thank you.

My heart goes out to the victims and their families.

But for everyone, if reading or watching the news about it (or the plethora of other negative things that are happening around the world) is depressing you/causing you anxiety - turn it off. 

Unless you can impact change, or are in some way involved, there is no point upsetting yourself further.

Newspapers and stations sell fear, it is what gets them eyes and thus revenue. Personally I don't ever watch the news on purpose, mainly because it is too depressing.

Due to the global society we live in, we now have access to bad news from around the world. There will never be a shortage of bad news for me to consume if I was so inclined.

Expressing some of my habits, feelings, and worries to others usually gets me strange looks and criticism. My mom and sister both think I may have anxiety or something with similar symptoms. However, my boyfriend thinks I'm just immature and like to overdramatize situations. 

I'm not sure which it is. Is there really something wrong, or am I just immature?

A little background for you: Dark childhood full of abuse and harassment from my father after my parents divorced when I was 8. My mom worked the night shift so I was stuck with my alcoholic/drug-addict father who had been diagnosed bipolar on top of that. He destroyed my self-esteem and I think have lingering affects from his abuse such as flinching at sudden movement and being extremely easily startled to the point of hyperventilation. Then my mom remarried to a man with Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder (it's different from OCD, don't feel like explaining) anyway, he was very emotionally abusive and controlling. Then I entered a relationship with a man who had Manic Depression who was physically abusive and extremely possessive and controlling. 

So, basically, my problem is that I panic when faced with any sort of change. Small or large, doesn't matter. Even when plans change, I just shut down, I have no idea how to handle it. I have to force myself to make phone calls, my heart races and I stutter. I can't deal with people raising their voices, I will immediately start crying, it freaks me out so bad. If faced with any sort of conflict, I panic. When my boyfriend is angry with me, I can't eat or sleep or think about anything until I know he's not mad anymore. I obsess over it until it's fixed, it's like my brain shuts down and the only thing I can process is that I need to apologize over and over and do whatever I can to make him forgive me. When I get nervous (and this happens almost daily) I pee like fucking crazy. Seriously, I'll make 3-5 trips to the bathroom within an hour or so. Whenever any kind of stress enters my life, I can barely eat or sleep and it's the only thing I can think about until it's resolved (this might be normal for any person enduring stress though)

I have 3 moods: Nervous, Numb, Excited (almost high feeling). 
Some days, I'm just on edge and I'm not sure why. It's like I'm waiting for something bad to happen. Other days, I feel nothing at all and just want to sleep. And sometimes, I feel restless, like I just gotta do something but I don't know what. I just can't sit still or focus on anything at all I just GOTTA DO SOMETHING, ANYTHING. 

I also have an issue with escapism and obsession. I find something I like and I obsess over it until I can't possibly learn anything more about it and I've already read and viewed everything available online. Then I move on to a new obsession. And when I say ""obsession"" I really do mean the literal definition of obsession. It consumes me. 

Anyway, these are the main issues that either friends, family, or myself have noticed may not be ""normal"". Boyfriend thinks I'm fine, just over-dramatic. Family thinks I should talk to someone. I personally don't want to spend the money on a psychiatrist if I'm just an immature, over-dramatic, typical woman. But, on the other hand, I'm sick of feeling the way I do and I just want to go a day without freaking out over something small and insignificant.

I asked what she thought would be most significant/impactful based on the list and her professional assessment; she identified 2-3 things (inc. grief and depression) as what she thinks are most major...

I'm incredibly baffled at how I'm supposed to choose one thing to focus on, when she herself identified more than one thing as significantly impacting my mental illnesses.

Has anyone else been in a similar situation? Advice and tips on zeroing in would be greatly appreciated.

I've made a few posts in the last couple of weeks regarding my therapist. This is NOT about that, go me. Back story to the little observation I'm about to make: I was treated multiple times (impatient and outpatient) for anorexia/bulimia as a teen and young adult. I had a moderately bad problem for about 5-6 years. After my last inpatient stint at 20 I began to actually put effort into my recovery, etc. and I haven't struggled with it too much in the last seven odd years. Worth noting that I did pick up a drug problem a few years prior that got very serious in my early twenties. I've been clean for almost two years today and still regularly participate in a twelve step fellowship. I'm only babbling to give you the correct context. Anyway, I had a baby two months ago and of course I'd put on a little bit of weight in my pregnancy (20-30 pounds.) One day about 4 weeks ago I woke up and looked in the mirror and, quite frankly, just lost my shit. I have become obsessed with my body/weight. I started a ""diet"" immediately that day. I began healthy enough, trying to do it the right way and all that. Then I just started cutting out more and more. First it was saturated fats, then all fats (with like really strange exceptions,) then it was carbs, now sugar as well. I started averaging around 1500 calories a day and now I'm breaking at about 500-700 a day. I can not seem to stop what I'm doing even though I know it's dangerous. I've lost enough weight in this short time that I am now below my pre-pregnancy weight. I am trying to challenge my irrational thoughts because realistically I know that I'm not hideous and disgusting. If I was I wouldn't get the attention that I do. Still, every time I look at myself I want to sob. It's very confusing and people keep complimenting how great I look and I just don't get it. I am incapable of being okay with mirrors right now. I also don't want anybody to touch me or watch me too closely. I've become this absolute obsessive mess! The anxiety that I get when I try to read food labels or see somebody eating a fucking cheeseburger is really terrifying. How could I fall down this rabbit hole after so many years of normalcy with food? And where does it come from and how do I stop? This is absolutely something I should be discussing with my therapist but I'm embarrassed given the circumstances. Please give me your feedback/suggestions.

auxxvoicesxx,False,False,1490244714,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/60zwpv/easily_confused_what_could_it_be/,60zwpv,True,2,False,1492439727,1,"I am known for being easily confused. My friends jokingly call me ""retarded"" (terrible word, I know), ""slow"", ""stupid"", etc. In fact, a lot of people in my life does (parents, siblings, significant other) so.

If asked, people will really use confused as an adjective to describe me.

I can hold a conversation with someone, and I have a 50/50 chance of hearing/understanding them. Sometimes I can't hear them, as in I can't understand what they are saying to me, even if they are talking directly at me/next to me/in my ear. Many times people give up on telling me something.

I have difficulties following instructions. I might attempt to follow them, but I forget steps easily. I might be the only person out of a group of 8 to not comprehend a set of directions and be able to carry them out. 

I am confused on where to go, as in moving my body. Let's say that I am setting up a dance formation with a group of people, and the dance instructor tells us to go to formation/chart 1. Even if I've been there multiple times a day, and there are markers relative to where I should be, I still never know where to go unless the other people make their way there. And even then, I sometimes end up in the wrong spot. 

I easily forget instructions, events, responsibilities, etc. I am involved in a few organizations and jobs, and I often forget what I am supposed to do, when I'm supposed to do it, and everything that I need to do in order to get things accomplished.

Even when I think I understand something, there's still a 25% chance that I actually don't/didn't, and won't realize until after the fact. I will think that I get a concept completely, or remember everything I need, or follow instructions completely, only to be told that I completely misunderstood something.

People yell at me a lot because of all of this. I am not a self-sufficient adult, so I rely on a lot of other people for transportation and to help me with some responsibilities (ex: time management, remembering things I need to do). When I fail at my part, the phrases ""should have been common sense"", ""that was dumb/stupid"", ""were you even thinking?"", etc. are thrown around with a seriously disapproving tone and expression. 

Sometimes when I am not confused about something (but later turns out that I misinterpreted/misunderstood), and I explain my thinking/logic, they said that I should have thought about it differently, and why didn't I ask if I was confused. When I explain that I wasn't confused, I am told that I was. When I explain my thinking/logic, I am told that for XX situation, I should have thought of/to do XX. When I explain that the thought didn't cross my mind, I am told that I shouldn't have to think about it.

I don't always ask for clarification when I am confused because sometimes I understand later on by myself, and then sometimes when I ask questions for clarification people respond as if I asked a stupid question. They look at me like I'm stupid, and that the answer should have been common sense, and then ask why I didn't think before I asked. But I genuinely ask because I don't want to assume anything because that's when I make mistakes the most. But I do ask questions that might seem redundant or commonsense, but I ask to make sure I'm not misunderstanding something. But people respond so negatively when I ask those kind of questions. Sometimes they don't respond and tell me to figure it out.

A lot of the times when I do/say something stupid, it is expected of me. People hold me to a lower standard sometimes because of that. They say that I did a good job, but it's relative to what little they expected. They say, ""it's okay, you're auxxvoicesxx"" or ""you're just being auxxvoicesxx"" or that I just had a ""auxxvoicesxx"" moment. 

What could my problem be? I really want to fix this because it is stressful. People generally don't think of me being competent. Sometimes they do, but then I do something stupid and they change their mind. I am only getting old and with more responsibilities, and I want to do great things in life, but if people often think something is wrong with me and I keep messing stuff up, how will I?

**TL;DR: I am easily confused. I don't understand when people are talking to me sometimes, I have difficulties following/understanding instructions, I often completely misunderstand conversations/instructions/concepts, I ask really redundant questions for clarity, people think I'm slow/confused all the time and say that I should have more common sense. I want to know what is wrong with me and how to fix it.**",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,"Easily Confused, What Could It Be?"

TL;DR  Looking for in-person, professional help from a doctor or similar credentials, in the Seattle area...  In the next 3 weeks. So that's a little problem too.


------  




Because of her culture's views on mental health, I actually had to run her through a list of symptoms, to which she answered my prompt of 1 - 10 on severity with almost all 10's, before I revealed to her I was listing off Google's standard definition of symptoms of Major Depression.   



She's put herself through University while holding 2-3 jobs for her family and self. Got work in Ukrainian media, then connections here in the US and then a contract job in my industry. She has hustled and made every gain in her budding career through sweat and tears, as far as I know.  



She has visited the U.S. multiple times, organized events for my industry here and abroad, is teaching herself programming, and doing due diligence on becoming a U.S. citizen.  



Yet... It is heartbreaking to see her ever-present sleeplessness, guilt, anxiety, eating problems, and relentless descent towards hopelessness & suicide.  As well as often occurrences with conventional depressive symptoms that leave her bedridden or trapped in her room.  

   

You know how it is almost like FAITH, in your belief and love for depression? No matter the facts? She has this in spades, despite being smart as a whip.  
She is without hope, a danger to herself, and it is scary to see a talent and mind like hers sliding down farther.

For around 2/3 years i suffered heavily with self confidence, anxiety and depression. They were very dark days however as of lately, i have been feeling better.

The problem i face, is not mine, but is my sisters. She's a 14 year teen heavily obsessed with how she looks.

I know she spends lots of time on the internet poisoning her mind, about how she looks and how she should. Its affected her so much so, she's taken advice from school and has been referred to seek mental advice externally - to which my parents were notified and this problem arose.

It's awful to hear, my sisters is going this through something i wouldn't wish on my enemy. 

We've tried to get her to do other activities with her friends, or with us to get her away from the internet and to occupy her time well - which i found to be of great use to me - my problem was also that i had a distorted perception of myself and others based on negative media.  

Given i'm a guy, i found it easy to escape through xbox with my friends, or going out and doing daft things boys do.

The point i'm trying to get to is:

Girls out there who have experienced this around THIS age. What can you recommend a 14 year old girl to do, who likes make up, doesn't like football, doesn't like sport, to occupy her self. If you have matured, looking back - what would have started doing with your time to escape?

Thanks,

I apologise if this isn't very read able, english was never my forte.

(I know it's long.. and If you get through it I am very grateful)


**Work and Focus:** Some days I go into work and I am beyond focused, I am unbelivably productive, proposing ideas that seem beyond my comprehension, and I am so well spoken it doesn't even feel right coming out of my mouth, I'm funny, friendly, loud. It literally feels like i've taken some kind of drug... and then other days, everything feels cloudy, I could't be productive if someone put a gun to my head, I can't get a clear sentence out, I am short tempered, and can't be bothered to even fake a smile in front of a client. I get into a ""nothing to loss"" mode, where I don't care about fighting what I'm feeling because its incredibly exhausting and fake. Theres no pattern to this, one day it can be one way, and then the next day the other, I never know what it'll be when I wake up. I honestly don't feel I can work a full time job anymore, the back and forth is exhausting and trying to make up for the ""off"" days  when I finally have ""on"" days feels hopeless.


**Mood Swings:** I can't make plans in advance because of my mood swings, one day I'll be super excited to go to ""so and so's birthday dinner"", and then when it comes around I'll dread the event so much that i'll cancel, but only after an hour or two of tears and panic, trying to go through the pros and cons in my head, or sometimes voicing them to my significnt other finally causing a frustrated ""I don't care what you do! Go or don't go, I'll just go alone. You ALWAYS do this."" 

This becomes conflicting because of my need to have organization and everything planned out. I'm not a ""role with the punches"" kind of person, I make lists, keep a calendar and like to have everything planned out and organized. It usually leads to trying to avoid making plans at all costs. This contradicting thing in my life causes a lot of stress and is horribly affecting my relationships/friendships.I have lost almost all my friends because of my ""flakey"" behaviour. (Which I don't blame them for at all, you can only get turned down so many times).


**Guilt, Worry, Fear, Feeling out of Control:** All 4, all the time. 

This is long and coming off as a diary entry.. but hopefully someone can relate and point me in the right direction. If you've made it this far, thank you.

The individuals that I am talking about are the youth who live in the more northern regions of Canada. You may be thinking, “So, you can’t avoid being bored, why should I care?” Well, the youth who reside in these northern regions are actually expected to die 5-7 years earlier than we will, and infant mortality rate is 2-3 times greater up north than it is where we live. Your right, these youth are not dying earlier directly BECAUSE of boredom, they’re dying earlier as a consequent of what boredom can bring.
	It is also important to note that there are other causes to the destructive behaviour these youth choose to engage in, however, boredom still remains a real contestant in the running for what causes a youth to engage in risky behaviour. Although, not the only cause, a major concern still in itself that desperately needs to be dealt with.  
	If I were to ask you what you did to avoid being bored, I am positive you could list a whole host of ideas for me. Perhaps, some of your ideas may include grabbing coffee with a friend, going to the shopping mall, heading to the movie theater with some friends, or going to your gym to get a workout in. All very good options if you find yourself to be bored. The problem is, most of these more northern parts of Canada do not have a Starbucks where you can grab a coffee with a friend on a whim, and they do not have malls like the Halifax Shopping Centre where you could browse for hours, nor is there a movie theater on every corner. Maybe you have thoughts like “ So they can’t go to Starbucks, but they can read a book or watch Netflix.” Speaking from personal experience, you can only read so many books and watch so many movies before that gets bored, and then what are you suppose to do? Those are not sustainable activities that are going to keep these youth engaged long enough to keep them from engaging in destructive behaviour.
	Perhaps I still have not convinced you that this is a real issue, so let me further explain why you should care. When there is nothing productive to engage these youth, they can turn to drugs, alcohol and other risky behaviours to fill the void. Youth in Northern Canada are more likely to have substance abuse problems, experience an unplanned teen pregnancy, and as a consequence of this have higher rates of fetal alcohol syndrome, and are more likely to not finish school. You may be thinking “Well, when I’m bored, I don’t turn to drugs and alcohol to entertain myself, so this isn’t an issue of boredom, but one of addiction and lack of education on sex safe”. You are correct in thinking this, but I encourage you to think more deeply at the root cause. If these youth had more outlets, like recreational sport, shop class and community programs to name a few, then they would have less time to engage in these negative behaviour. Is this issue now something worthy of our attention? I believe so, and I want to help change it so that these youth are given every opportunity that we are given when we were growing up and I need your help to do it.
	I do not claim to be an expert on all things related to boredom and Northern Canada, but I am able to recognize the injustices that we, as more developed provinces and communities, have allowed to happen to the individuals who reside up north. As Canadians, we have an abundance of resources and opportunities, but it is unfair that the people who live in the more northern parts of the country are excluded from much of these resources and opportunities. I think their needs have been ignored for too long and I want to do something about it. I believe we should not have to see youth with substance abuse problems at the high rates that we do, we should not have to see many young girls experiencing unplanned pregnancies, and we should not have to see so many youth dropping out of school!
	If we are going to fix these problems, we need to examine one of the root causes; which happens to be boredom. How do we solve boredom? How are we going to solve such an intangible issue that plagues every single person on this planet? I believe with the right people on board, we will be able to offer our support, and our ideas, and we will see real lasting change happen that benefit these youth. 
	So, I encourage everyone and anyone with any interest in this kind of work to consider taking a job in smaller, more northern communities around Canada. These communities need all our help, so I hope I was successful in convincing you that your talent, creativity and compassion are desperately needed if we are going to give these at risk youth every opportunity they deserve.

This entails informing services of how best to tailor treatment to help people in all stages of anorexia, and this is how the information will be used. 
Any information you include is completely confidential and anonymous. 

We fully understand this is a really sensitive and upsetting topic, yet if you or anyone you know of has had any experience of an eating disorder could complete this questionnaire (link above and below), it would be very much appreciated.

The initial response was a panic attack I think? I dont know. My chest felt tight, my heart was pounding, and I couldn't breathe. I almost started crying but managed to hold back my tears.

I ended up going to the counseling center and I was in a vulnerable enough spot that I was able to just word-vomit a lot on my mind.

I've made a few posts in the last couple of weeks regarding my therapist. This is NOT about that, go me. Back story to the little observation I'm about to make: I was treated multiple times (impatient and outpatient) for anorexia/bulimia as a teen and young adult. I had a moderately bad problem for about 5-6 years. After my last inpatient stint at 20 I began to actually put effort into my recovery, etc. and I haven't struggled with it too much in the last seven odd years. Worth noting that I did pick up a drug problem a few years prior that got very serious in my early twenties. I've been clean for almost two years today and still regularly participate in a twelve step fellowship. I'm only babbling to give you the correct context. Anyway, I had a baby two months ago and of course I'd put on a little bit of weight in my pregnancy (20-30 pounds.) One day about 4 weeks ago I woke up and looked in the mirror and, quite frankly, just lost my shit. I have become obsessed with my body/weight. I started a ""diet"" immediately that day. I began healthy enough, trying to do it the right way and all that. Then I just started cutting out more and more. First it was saturated fats, then all fats (with like really strange exceptions,) then it was carbs, now sugar as well. I started averaging around 1500 calories a day and now I'm breaking at about 500-700 a day. I can not seem to stop what I'm doing even though I know it's dangerous. I've lost enough weight in this short time that I am now below my pre-pregnancy weight. I am trying to challenge my irrational thoughts because realistically I know that I'm not hideous and disgusting. If I was I wouldn't get the attention that I do. Still, every time I look at myself I want to sob. It's very confusing and people keep complimenting how great I look and I just don't get it. I am incapable of being okay with mirrors right now. I also don't want anybody to touch me or watch me too closely. I've become this absolute obsessive mess! The anxiety that I get when I try to read food labels or see somebody eating a fucking cheeseburger is really terrifying. How could I fall down this rabbit hole after so many years of normalcy with food? And where does it come from and how do I stop?

Mary is the mother of two daughters and I met her through work, she introduces me to her daughter Rachel(17) and we begin dating shortly after. Upon first glance I thought her whole family was normal, she has a nice husband two beautiful daughters and they live with their grandma at home. However, while I start coming by their house more and more, I start to see that Rachel's sister, Tina by to the house and they learned of what happened but let it go because Steve didn't come off to them as abusive at all (he really isn't but he has a very short temper). Mary was also home at the time and started talking to them with Steve's presence, she was going off on a tangent and mentioned a word of ""divorce"" and this blew Steve's fuse and brought out his temper to the point where the officer arrested him. He got out of jail the next day on the condition that he will not be alone with any of the children without an adult. 

This is where I come in, I am Rachel's boyfriend (18) and she is 17. Normally their grandma is home and the situation is not much of a problem, but very recently their grandma became ill and is now hospitalized, so I am the one that would have to stay with them while they are with him, just spending the nights as he is busy working and only staying at home until night comes. 

At this point, I knew that there was something that was a bit off with Tina but I didn't think much of it until I spent some more time around her. When her grandma came back from the hospital and was bed ridden, Tina came up to her grandmother and told her to go die in chinese, I picked up on this because she thought . Which is honestly one of the worst things that you can ever say to an elder in our culture. I told Rachel and she was very upset that Tina said that, but we didn't tell anything to Mary. That night I went for a walk with Everett and learned about not only her troubling behavior with him, but at school as well. She would throw things in class and she would also walk out of class walking into different ones causing a huge ruckus, literally laughing maniacally. I took this into note and kept my distance from her. Up until last night.

Her grandma became hospitalized again and I left my current house. So I was asked to stay for a few nights until she gets released from the hospital. This night, I come home kind of late and Tina was in Steve's room with the door locked and he came home a little bit after I did (1am) He comes home to find his door locked and starts yelling at Tina why his door was locked. She started giving blank responses (nonsense) and stormed out with a huge mess in his room, and left to her room. This blew Steve's fuse and he picked up the mess that she made and threw it in her room. At which this point I was about to go and take a shower and thought things would die down after, it didn't. Tina went out and started yelling at him because she left her Nintendo ds in his room and wants it back, to which he refused to let her go and get it. An argument ensues and things start to get thrown around. They move into the living room where she knocks down the TV and starts throwing everything that she can get her hands on. Coke bottles, opening them up and throwing them, glass bottles, anythings. She was a tornado. We called the police and they came, they calmed her down up until Mary came home (hospital). When Mary heard the news and saw the mess, she did not do anything to fix the situation and cradled Tina like it wasn't her fault.

I guess this was just a huge vent because it shook me up how a child could do such a thing, the things I saw and witnessed and the lack of common sense and respect. It also sort of boggles me how Mary still hasn't done anything for Tina to get her the help that she needs. I feel like Mary is very ignorant and hard headed, and won't accept the fact that there is something wrong with Tina and Steve is very short tempered and that can be problematic at times. I'm not sure what to do to help them. I want to help but I don't know how I should. 

Also, another thing I forgot to mention about Tina, before her grandma left to the hospital the other day, she asked her ""Which are you more afraid of? The hospital or me?"" to which she said she was more afraid of her granddaughter.

(Newest TL;DR at very bottom)

So for some short background on myself, I'm currently 19, female, I'm from Utah (if that makes any difference) and I've had severe clinical depression and anxiety for 11 years. I've recently found out I have several other disorders, or whatever you wanna call them. One that might be worth mentioning is PTSD. **(Edit: This doesn't in  any way include everything I have; I'm only including what could be important.)** I was in the hospital twice last September, and while the first experience was alright looking back, the second one was absolutely horrible. Because of the last experience I swore to myself that no matter how bad things got I would NEVER go back to a hospital, of any kind, for ANY reason.
What I need help with is kind of weighing pros and cons I guess. In retrospect the past four months have been unusually hard, and I've become incredibly suicidal. I've always struggled with being suicidal. Tonight, actually, I almost went through with it. My outlook on the world has never been flowery, cheerful, or enjoyable. This has especially gotten worse within the last three months. I struggle to even get out of bed and do something before 5pm, and I usually don't go to sleep until 5 or so in the morning. I've become even more cynical, hateful, angry and ""bomb-like."" I don't see any good in the world and I'm sick of other people and being alive. I know I need help, but I've been like this for a very long time, and I know it will be incredibly difficult to change years of thinking, habits, and beliefs. I've never had good experiences with therapy, and I feel the profession is a joke. With that being said, I think what I need most is someone to talk to and help me sort out my feelings - a therapist.
Before I get too far from my original point... I don't really know if I trust myself, and I think going back to the hospital could be a good thing. Why I'm hesitant, and almost reluctant, is because I freak out when I feel like I'm trapped and that's basically what happens at the hospital. I can't leave or do what I want when I want. I don't want to feel like a trapped bird, and have people look down at me (the staff). Another thing I'm concerned about is that I frequently vape, and I'll get sick if I can't. I'm worried that I wouldn't be able to go outside and vape when I need to. I also hate the entrance process, the whole strip search/check thing and it makes me incredibly uncomfortable.
When I left the hospital the last time, I had gotten incredibly sick and left in a worse mental and physical state than I arrived in. The staff were beyond rude and negligent, and I never got the care I needed. I think going back (to a different hospital of course) could be very beneficial, but I'm too nervous about all of the unknowns. 
Oh and I don't currently have insurance, besides insurance from my parents that cover doctor visits. I don't have a job, money to pay for being hospitalized, or insurance that would cover that. That's another hesitation I have. I literally can't afford to go into debt right now; I barely have enough money to pay my rent.

I guess before I ramble on before much longer, with all of taken into consideration, do you guys think it could be good?

TL;DR: Been incredibly depressed and suicidal lately, and I'm considering being admitted to a hospital again. I'm hesitant though, because the last two times I was hospitalized, were HORRIBLE experiences. I left in worse condition then I went in. I don't have money or insurance to cover the visits. Could admitting myself be beneficial?

Edit: I have decided not to admit myself, and I'm glad I didn't. I'm just going to figure out how to deal with personality and mood disorders on my own and hope it works.
Thank you to the one person who attempted to answer the question.

**Edit:** If possible, I need to ask once again for help with my dilemma. I'm coming to believe I need to go back, but with my attitude towards the human race as a whole and hospitalization, I'm not very sure it would improve my situation. On the other hand, I have no routines, nothing I enjoy doing. It's become a task to be alive and get out of bed, and I'm getting sick of this burden. Again my biggest concern is that I don't have insurance, I hardly have any money, and I've had deplorable experiences in the past that make me never want to return to any hospital. They may be able to temporarily ease my struggle, my burden, but I know it won't do much to help me long term. I hate how you are treated in those places, the lack of respect, kindness, and general human empathy. They act as though you are a horrible, plagued monster and look down upon you with disgust. And again, I'm NOT looking for resources or what you think will help. I am ONLY looking for someone who can help weigh the pros against the cons.
**Extra Edit:** I'm not worried, or concerned, about diagnoses. Words attempting to describe how my mind functions don't concern me. What I'm preoccupied with is my ever growing hate for our species, and the darkness and emptiness I feel everyday. I don't take pleasure in anything anymore, I hardly eat, I only leave my apartment to get groceries occasionally, etc. I want to actually enjoy doing anything, or being alive for that matter. I've spent the entire life I can remember like this. There's no quality of life here, there's not even living. Just surviving. Honestly, I'm sick of it and either want to end it or enjoy life. Whichever approaches me sooner is the one I will choose. Small side note: I apologize for the fact that this probably sounds very bitter and angry, and anyone reading this should know it's not directed at said reader. I simply have a very strong dislike for most people, and that comes across in just about everything I do. Regardless, I do apologize for any hostilities or resentment felt.

**Extra TL;DR:** Problems have popped up again, thinking again I need to visit a hospital, although very cautious and hesitant. Staff I've dealt with are horrible, ignorant even. I don't have insurance and I barely have any money. Could it be beneficial? *Only looking for responses that can answer the question of: could hospitalization be a good thing?",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,Need Some Advice On the Best Course of Action [Suicide][Hospitalization]
MikefromtheCHAN,False,False,1490327844,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/616uyv/worst_depressionanxiety_starving_to_death_and/,616uyv,True,3,False,1492443488,1,"Okay, so, I ruined my life financially with a 1 year Heroin addiction that I finally managed to kick 2-ish months ago. My depression was already bad during and before the Heroin use but got so bad I couldn't really function anymore. I got through the H detox, after week or two brain felt back to normal post Withdrawal Symptoms. Most things came back: I could cry again which was nice (Anhedonia tho), still severe depression and anxiety because the shame, no money, fear and self-hatred. 

Anyways, there was one Withdrawal symptoms (no Dopamine) that remained; I had absolutely no appetite and was even repulsed by food. I've 'detoxed' off Opioids in the past and never had lingering effects. So it's been 49 days or something since I lost appetite; had maybe 6-7k calories over this stretch. I'm going to end up in the Hospital anyway if this doesn't change so I'll probably go within a week.

I was on no other drugs after the Heroin detox so it's not symptoms from some other withdrawal. Mom, being worried about how bad my state was, got me in with a free Psychiatrist a month ago. He prescribed me, after a lot of my input, a SNRI, Wellbutrin, Mirtazapine. The Mirt was my idea since I needed any immediate help and Mirtazapine is essentially an Agonist rather then reuptake inhibitor. Went and got the meds from store, took them instantly, kinda surprisingly had no noticeable side effects but also didn't feel any better. Well, it's been a month on the Cymbalta and Wellbutrin at high doses, and I feel no better. I've never had success with antidepressants - tried most SSRIs with and without Wellbutrin, Effexor and Amitriptyline. Never helped much if at all, even during the best period of my life when I had some self-esteem, bought new car, saving money, stable. Still extremely introverted with rejection phobia, anxiety (mostly social), and wasn't able to feel/act like an average person unless drunk or on Opioids. Still no gf because I'm so terrified of interacting when them and that feel is hitting me especially hard lately, though I'm finaly trying to improve via meds and therapy. 

My thoughts/memory haven't been great the past week or so - still function well enough but can't write coherently and forget details. Anyway, this is all so f-ing bizarre and the only thing that's ever afflicted me, not knowing why or even how it happened. It's like withdrawal from a Dopamine Agonist type anti-appetite. No way in hell it's PAWS from 2+ months ago, this is WAY too severe for that. I've been trying to force myself to eat a little the past few days, but I can't and it's not nearly enough for sustenance. Hospital seems inevitable now; not sure what they could even DO, but this is very very not good. I've lost a lot of weight obviously, it's been nice cause I got fat on Heroin and am down to a healthy, attractive weight. 

I don't know why I'm posting this - maybe for similar experiences from you guys, thoughts on how/why this happened, etc. All I god damn want is to be 'normal' socially, able to have a career, not constantly worry and hate myself. I've felt totally hopeless like never before and I don't have the time to go through the ridiculous Med types and combos. I've been 100% committed mentally to treatment this time, and think I'll be a far happier, social person than I've ever been. It's probably important to mention I've been using (at times heavily) alcohol, opiods, whatever else that makes me feel 'normal-ish' since 14. If anyone reads this, thank you in advance and we're all gonna make it, brah.

anyways, now I find my anxiety to be a lot worse. i have both GAD and social anxiety. both suck, but social anxiety is the main thing that's completely fucking up my life. my anxiety is so bad that i completely avoid applying to jobs in person. it scares me way to much and i nearly have a panic attack every time i muster up the courage to do so. i mainly just apply to jobs online because of this, and we all know that's not a very good way to get a job.

just getting out and applying for jobs isn't the only part that's ruining things for me.

IanThaGame,False,False,1490362903,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/618z60/ockhams_razor_do_i_have_aspergers/,618z60,True,2,False,1492444643,2,"I was recently confronted with the prospect that I could have Asperger’s Syndrome, after it was expressed to me without much rhyme or reason, it had been suggested by my driving instructor as she had taught someone with it prior and felt I had similar traits (this was unspecified).

Although it was not brought up by my driving instructor, I can only assume the driving instructor had a hunch and decided to tip of my mum, who clearly unprepared for this inquired advice from the girl I had been volunteering for over the past weeks, who then I assume, told people from talent match, leading up to an odd and perplexing confrontation. They didn't specify any action that I perform that gave them the impression, nor did they take any time to explain what it is or why they think I might have it. This leads me to believe it was rushed and I don’t I think the appropriate research was equated before bringing it up in such a fashion, It could be paradoxically problematic that if I do have it, I would likely not be able to process the situation applicably anyway.
 
This interaction was immediately proceeded by a strange interview about career options, not really giving me any time to rest after receiving the news. The four people arched around, looking at me, as I was slowly becoming more self-conscious about my body language and start to fear that looking away or being completely dismissive would somehow constitute anti-social behaviour. 

I could only find myself trying to read their language in which to figure out how much had been told to them. When questioned about my hobbies, I often find myself choosing to say football and dance, because they are the most common and socially applicable of my interests. Towards the end I noticed that at times I was being pinned to the singular identity of ‘football fan’. I wondered whether it was because they knew a common symptom of Asperger’s is having ‘restricted and specific interests of which you know vast amounts.’ Or maybe they just like football.

The way they spoke gave occasional slip to the knowledge that they were making assumptions. Which I worry about when approaching people and deciding to tell them, it can be reliving to suddenly have a word that labels your behaviour and to find out there are other people like you. Though it can be dangerous when done incorrectly as many can be susceptible to The Illusory Truth Effect, in which something said enough times will eventually be construed as truth in your mind. 

I can’t help but be a little irritated that they chose to snake behind me instead of asking me straight on from the beginning, and I'm perfectly aware that I act strange at times, as if I equate the mannerisms akin to a robot that watches and attempts to replicate human behaviour. I have been asked on a couple of occasions if I had ADD but never thought to get checked as I've never felt that it impeded in my life in any way.

I was reminded of a time with my previous driving instructor where he was non-saliently asking whether I had ever been tested for anything, and especially now, although initially upsetting, I can appreciate the honesty. Although it makes me wonder, as apparently there is something about the way I drive that makes me seem anti-social, or maybe I just don’t talk much because I’m trying to concentrate on driving.

It seems like something small blown out of proportion by the fear and unknowing of aligning someone with the autistic spectrum. As autism comes in such a wide spectrum it is difficult to cultivate how to approach the subject, or how someone will react, yet alone get to the point of diagnosis. Having read up, and done some research, I couldn’t relate to any of the stories I read, or even to see any correlation whatsoever. The symptoms often associate with an ‘inability to understand social cues’ and empathy. 

When I was at university I took on the role of chairman in a society of over a hundred people and went out with them every other night. I specifically remember having a convocation with the previous chairman in which I had become closely acquainted, telling me I got the position because I was always trying to make friends with everyone, and being told something like that by somebody I respect was incredible to me. I’ve even written and directed my own short films, both of these I hold dear as trophies of my overcoming anxiety, but even attempting to list my achievements, I think maybe I could be being over defensive by trying to convince myself I don’t have anything.

I struggle to seek the value of money or material gain nor did I particularly want a degree at the time, it just seemed to be what everyone else did. I often lived by the philosophy that memories are the most important possession a person can have. Spending inordinate amounts and dropping any work I had to go out drinking out of fear I could miss out. Drinking had given me inflated confidence as I was suddenly able to approach strangers, talk to girls and giving me a strong feeling of euphoria and pride for something I once found difficult. Maybe I’m an alcoholic, or maybe that’s pretty common behaviour for a university student. 
Ever since I was inevitably kicked out of university for not doing much work, I don't really feel like myself anymore, I spend most of my time locked up in my room watching movies and reading philosophy books to distract myself with ethics and existential questions larger than myself. I can see why people would be worried about me as I have never been particularly open, though I have always been quite relaxed and able to look after myself. Maybe I don’t go out because I’m anti-social, or maybe I just have no friends here and nowhere to go.

Another common symptom of Aspergers is requiring clear structure which I am not particularly fond of, I would happily uproot my life and move to Iceland without blinking, given the opportunity. I much prefer not knowing what is ahead of me and approaching new situations as they develop.

I am extremely appreciative of the life that I have, so much so I frequently do my best not appear ungrateful and I regularly find myself attain the attributes of a wooden stave restricting my movement and giving answers as short as possible in which to prevent adding fuel to the fire of tautological information hurdling towards me. I am incredibly happy to have people around that care about me. But trying not to seem ungrateful has lead more and more to an Inability to complain and just watching as other people talk for me instead.

I’ve always been fascinated by the popular notion that the majority of great artists have mental illnesses of sorts, which gives them unique perspective to make interesting art, and being on an art course at university for few years, it seemed as if everybody, including the teachers, wore these ailments as if trophies comparable to trading cards, and I could just envision them bragging: “I’m a level 40 autist with mild depression and OCD boosters.” 

I took numerous tests online just to check, none of which even came close to a diagnosable range, at this point, I’m about 90% sure I don’t have Aspergers. Though it is still entirely possible that I have some other disorder, even so, it just seems like creating a problem where there isn’t one. Even if I do have a disorder, I have never particularly struggled with any aspect of my life, nor have I ever been faced with a challenge that eluded me to the point of feeling inept. By definition, disorders can only be diagnosable if you have numerus symptoms and if they are ‘ongoing, frustrating impairments’. 

When I’m alone, I find I am occasionally teaching myself seemingly arbitrary skills in which to make me seem more interesting. I once taught myself to say the words ‘I don’t know’ in numerous different languages just so that when somebody asked why, I could jokingly reply “je ne sais pas”. And it took me three days to teach myself to solve a Rubix cube. I also can’t help but be intrigued at the idea of being a Rain Man style savant, though I’m probably pushing it. I’ve never had a problem with learning but I still find myself switching between learning large amounts, and creating great proportions of work, in a short bursts, followed by seemingly doing nothing and letting the world move intrinsically around me for large quantities of time like I’m in a Beckett play. Switching between two ends of a spectrum. Maybe I’m bi-polar, or maybe I just rest sometimes when I’m tired. 

“There are two ways to be fooled. One is to believe what isn’t true; the other is to refuse to believe what is true.” – Søren Kierkegaard

As not to let emotional proximity shroud my judgment, I always try to take some time to think before I can take on advice in which to approach it objectively, though it has only been a few days since it happened and I may have sounded a little passive-aggressive at times. So I apologise if anything slipped through. 

Do you think I could have something? Or maybe I’m just weird.

On it I feel much more stable, more easily able to face my problems. Off it, I feel like I'm a pingpong ball being slapped between trying to 'take life one step at a time with a smile' and being happy and normal, and being incredibly anxious and depressed for vague, silly reasons, feeling unable to break away from those feelings.


Now I feel like I'm off it again. I missed a good few days between renewals, but I've done that before and always been okay after a few days of being back on them. Not this time. I feel emotional, wanting to cry at the drop of a hat, and constantly bouncing between trying to tell myself it'll be okay, distracting myself or being anxious, terrified or depressed about the future and my chances at 'success.' 


I feel like I've already fucked up too much, like I don't have the strength or willpower to fix it. I'm twenty-five and I have no idea what I want out of life. 


I have a job as a personal caretaker for people with disabilities that I enjoy, or at least tolerate on the bad days, and it's something I care about. It's enough to pay my rent and bills and groceries and let me save up a little bit at a time. Part of me would like to pick up more hours, but I'm scared off committing myself to something I ultimately can't see through, especially where I'm already usually beat at the end of my work week. How people manage 60 hour work weeks frequently I can't comprehend - I struggle with 36. 


I'm heavily overweight. This is one of my main sources of that feeling of 'too late, can't fix.' I packed on a massive amount in college and regretted it ever since. I look into exercises and eating better, but I can never stay committed. I lack willpower, and then I hate myself for that, and then I get depressed and anxious again.


I'm part of a big chat group of friends, have a smaller group of separate friends who I used to talk to frequently but do less now (which does have me a bit nervous, but I only have so much social energy) and since November I have a boyfriend from the former group. In many ways I guess he's my first 'real' boyfriend - I had one online who I'm still friends with and care for, and my best friend growing up and I dated a while, but this feels more real. We talk about the future, actually have plans to meet in person next month. I'm happy with him, but also terrified I'm not right for him, or he's not right for me, or of just royally fucking things up.


I guess all these issues, writing them down, come down to a lack of commitment. I'm scared of committing myself to something in case I can't handle it and fuck it up, and because everything ends at some point. Because I feel like I'm not strong enough to keep anything going long enough to make decent change. If I lack willpower and strength to just function on a 'normal' level, why shouldn't I give up? Why shouldn't I just withdraw and mope and curl up in bed and cower until I work up the nerve to at least make one final commitment, permanently?


That got a bit dramatic. tl;dr, I just hate this constant bouncing between 'it'll be okay, chin up!' and 'listing suicide methods in my head like I did when I was first depressed.' I don't know what to do or how to make positive changes in my life, where to start. I should go to my doctor, but he's a two-hour bus ride away and dealing with him is constantly frustrating. (One of the worst-rated doctors in the city, and it'll be months if not years before I can get another.)


I feel helpless, weak and stupid, and every little thing is frustrating me and making me teary. No idea what to do. I should be a goddamn grown-up and pick myself up by my bootstraps, but just that thought itself makes me want to curl back up in bed and ignore the fact that I exist for a while.

Any advice?

How common is the difficulty breathing side effect? Should I be concerned? 

The Trazodone confuses me since I was specifically given it to help with sleeping problems, but I can't see anything on the paperwork about it being used for that. Everything just says its anti-anxiety, with a side effect of difficulty sleeping so like... What. 

Buspirone HCL confuses me the most. I'm supposed to take it as needed whenever I'm anxious, up to 2x/day. But it also says to make sure I take it on a consistent basis, and not to miss a dose.

The first is a book about my personal experiences from being depressed to becoming and maintaining being happy, the other is a simple book comprised of other peoples perspectives, so that it might inspire some people or make them think a little differently.

So basically I'd like you to write for me about the subject, what you think happiness is and how to maintain it. It can be whatever you like, it can be a couple of lines or a whole essay. It'll be put in the book along with your Reddit username. (You can also choose to remain anonymous if you prefer - just say so)

At the request of the subreddit's admin, I'd like to say that the smaller book will be self published and put on sale for next to nothing and/or given away with the larger project. I'm not sponsored and I don't have any other motivation for doing this other than my own interest in the subject.

Upon finally doing some research myself and self observation I believe it to be a lot deeper than that. I believe I could possibly have Borderline Personality Disorder. I do have a couple of psych appointments coming up.  

I am a 28 year old Male. My biggest problems stem from relationships. I have had anger issues with my family in the past but with age and time it has gotten better. I also suffer from a type of anxiety akin to Agoraphobia but less severe. I can leave my house but once I start getting so far from home I get anxiety. It's worse in areas I know I'm far from a hospital and unbearable if I have no cell phone service.

I am currently going through a tough breakup which has caused me to really dig into what is wrong with me and seek help. Something I should have done years ago.

All of my relationship patterns are the same. Please know as I type this I am aware these are serious problems. I start off being the center of these girls attention. They feel so lucky to have me. I don't care as much as I should because I know I have nothing to worry about. Eventually I realize what I have and I start being super sweet and caring. Somewhere in the midst of this there's the transition from not caring at all to clingy insecure me.

I start to question whether they care about me, view them as better than me. I will compare and over analyze all of their past relationships. I will start fights over the smallest things such as if I were to ask if they wanted to see me and I'm met with ""if you want to"". I'll threaten break ups and when they don't chase me I blame them for not caring. I know all of this is horrible and not the way a well adjusted adult should act in a relationship. 

I chose not to go out with them and their friends as the times when I do I feel like they should be on my hip the entire time.

I'm kind of just venting to get all of this out there because I am tired of ruining things with amazing people because I don't know how to handle things. 

I have tried ""just ignoring it"" and a few different things I've read online. I just think I'm so insecure. A lot of insecurity self help has said to go out and bethere yourself which is decent advice. I feel tho I should be able to be comfortable with myself instead of everytime I think a better looking gup or a more well off guy is interested in someone I'm dating I shouldn't have to go hit the gym or look for a better job.

1.she is devestated because we are each others first partners and only friend.

2.now she is 30 unmarried childless and probably won´t be able to have a kid.

Now i realised what i have done to her and how cruel and insane it is i feel really bad, i am lying now 3 months in my bed thinking about her and our cat......

I think the worst part is that i stayed with her for two years and lied about marriage and wanting kids...........

I don´t know really why I did it. I was in love in denial about her age and just wanted to be together.....

why i think it is forgivable what I did..

i was 17 I had no bad intentions and i tought she was 21 instead of 26 (she put wrong age on her dating profile i discovered her age when i already moved there...

i was in love (i am still       but i didn´t want to lose her 

There is a huge change she will never get a family of her own or get married. 

I don´t know if i can forgive my self for this, I really didn´t know this was going to happen.

I didn´t know womans get kids at 30 and married etc.....


Sorry for bad grammar i am using my phone.

I have never been able to get pleasure from ordinary, everyday things. I have always found it really hard to enjoy what other people enjoy, it's really rare for me to feel enthusiastic or excited about something, and even when I do, generally it lasts only for a short period of time. Normal things are boring for me. I can't enjoy watching sports or TV shows, in general I don't like what other people like. As a result, I always feel like an outcast, as if I don't belong, I feel lonely even when I'm around people. 
In the past, in my adolescence I have managed to keep this feeling under control by forcing myself to think about something else or by telling myself that with time, it would get better. But it's not getting better, it's getting worse. I am 19 now, and this feeling has grown and  has become more pervasive.  I feel like there is a huge void inside me.
At times this emptiness becomes overwhelming and I'm unable to do anything but desperately trying to fill the void I have inside.
 Even the so called ""quick fixes"", like alcohol (I live in Italy, here the drinking age is 18) have limited effect.
Now, when i do manage to achieve some pleasure or contentment I usually get it from the ""extreme"" versions of what works for most other people; so in order to get any pleasure from drinking, I have to down no less than an entire bottle of wine (note that here no tolerance is involved). I'm normally indifferent to food, but I manage to get some pleasure from fat and salt-laden junk food.

I still have no idea what this feeling is or whether it can be part of a particular mental illness. I have read on the internet about a thing called ""Reward deficiency syndrome"", but most of the websites that talked about it also tried to sell you supplements and other shit, so I wouldn't give them too much merit.

Anyway, can anyone of you relate? Have you ever experienced anything like this? If you have, how did you deal with it?
Thank you in advance guys, and sorry for the long post.

I'm just a teenager. Although some may not concur, I believe that one's behavior and actions are weak, almost trifling, at swaying the path of one's life, but that's not to say choices don't matter. The fragile future can sometimes fade far from view, especially if one stays foolish of the changes they've faced over the years. I, for example, am no longer the child I was, say, two or three years ago, but there is a faint remnant of the innocence I once cherished so wholeheartedly.

Growing up, I've always outshone my peers in academics, but the mere concept of ""talking with people"" was foreign, almost unfathomable, for such an innately timid person like myself, who would laugh when others were sad or let people, even sincere ones, abuse my kindness due to fear of rejection.

Confined within my own desolate mind, once puberty struck, bizarre erotic fantasies burgeoned, while loneliness ensued. They're all violent thoughts of fondling unconscious bodies, killing my sexual ""partner,"" and mutilating them. An average person would be disgusted, but I shamefully will admit a sort of pleasure, thinking about such great power in these fantasies. They evoke sexual arousal in me and overwhelmed any repulsion that I held(and still do) about such macabre subjects as death or murder. I've developed an obsession with these ""intrusive thoughts."" 

Matters grew worse once I unearthed something else about myself--dissecting animals was ""fun"" to me. The act of wielding a kitchen knife, repeatedly slashing the dead animal's delicate flesh and slitting it open to witness the viscera that glisten pinkish-red as blood flows out slowly -- it's just too entrancing and calming to me. My heartbeat gradually accelerates while pleasure races through my body from the mere sight. It's amazing how something, once alive, is under my control and how it's all intertwined together. 

Although I'm discontent with school and my social life, or lack thereof, which is something I'm reluctant to change, my family is more than nurturing. I love them dearly, and my personal ""problems"" are in no way shape or form derived from their love. I simply lack the capacity for human emotional connection, and that's intrinsic.

Basically, I'm a socially inept, yet hard-working teen who has no true aspirations in life and puts on a mask of normality to conceal their loneliness. And I'm excited by thoughts of murder and dismemberment due to this desperate need for control. AND the actual act of mutilating. A very hazardous combination if you ask me.

The issue worsens as I mature in age, but not in mind, I suppose.

I've always been a moody person - its just kind of my personality I guess.

Today I woke up and just couldn't deal with my responsibilities (or the fact my boyfriend went out of town on his own accord and only told me at 2:30 am the night before/technically day of - its only for the weekend but im a W R E C K over it lol). I spent like 2-3 hours just crying in between getting angry at my boyfriend and apologizing to him when I went too far with my anger (another tendency of mine). 

And its like it suddenly went away. For the past few hours now, I have been sitting at my computer reading things and just not comprehending them. My mind is so foggy and I can't feel a trace of emotion which is ridiculous earlier because I was so damn emotional. I went to get food (finally attempting some self care? lol!) and I barely remember doing so.

Surely this isn't normal going from FEELINGS!!!!!!!!!!! to ""what is emotion"" is not normal right? I feel like a robot. I dont know how I am typing this but my fingers are making it happen thank god. All I want out of life is to feel happy and loved and it's like every day is a struggle to feel both. Im only happy when I'm around my bf and when I'm apart from him, I fall into pieces and stop caring for myself. I cant stand myself all I do is hurt people I care about and I'm so tired of it how can i change this?

I'm a 23 year old female living in Arizona, USA. I live with my two year old daughter and her father, but he and I are no longer together due to my behavior. I've never been diagnosed as having any kind of mental health issues, but I feel like there is something wrong with me.  

I'm needy. I want far more attention than any human being is able to give to me. When they fail to give me the amount of attention I feel I need, I become paranoid that they don't love me, and that realization makes me more demanding that they prove me wrong. It's ugly and unrelenting. I don't want to be this way and I want the pity party to stop so I can move on with life and allow those around me to do the same. But I'm afraid to get professional help.  

Last year I willingly admitted myself to a hospital for help after having suicidal thoughts. I soon abandoned treatment when CFSS told me they would have to investigate my child's well-being if they decided I was ill enough to need to be in a residential facility. I told them I was fine, forget about it and I left.  

Now I'm back in the same position. I shouldn't be around my daughter like this, I know that. I don't want to rub off on her and make her a needy mess, too. But I'm afraid if I seek help, they'll use it against me and keep her from me. I know that I need help. At this rate, she'll have to be without me if I don't get help anyway, but I'm still afraid for some reason.  

What's wrong with me? Can I do something effective to calm down and learn to trust people enough to give them space before I lose my family for good? I'm not willing to hurt someone else by giving up, but today I started thinking it would mess them up less to find me dead than it would be to continue living with me. That thought scared me, so I'm reaching out.  

I'm not even sure if I have a legitimate mental issue or if I'm just a self-righteous child who is too demanding. I do know that I want to change. Does anyone else feel this way? Can I stop this?  

I'm sorry for rambling. The thoughts seemed much clearer before I started typing them out. Thank you.",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,"My behavioral issues are ruining my life, but I'm afraid to seek help."

My whole life I have been told that I was ""a worrier""- by my teachers, friends and family. I worry about things that I know I shouldn't worry about but I can't help it. For years (and still now) I would try to sleep and I wouldn't be able to because I would focus on my breathing and feel like if I didn't focus on it I would just stop, and would spend the whole night panicking and trying to breathe- and its so difficult to breathe when that happens. Even though I know that this is completely stupid and illogical since breathing happens involuntarily it still happens. And I'll even worry during the day that I won't be able to sleep at night because of this making me more scared to go to sleep. Every day I am exauhsted. I am having constant headaches (i thought it was dehydration but turns out its not) and my whole body just feels tense and sore. I will check every door in my house to see if it is locked multiple times in a row and when I leave to go to school and am on  my way walking to the subway I will turn around and go back home again to check if the door is really locked. I will literally cry at any given moment and anything will reduce me to tears. I can be downstairs brushing my teeth and my brother will walk in and for some reason it will scare me and I will feel like I have to cry. I know this is stupid but I can't help it. I am constantly pulling and twirling around my hair and my friends make fun of me for it and my parents scream about it telling me its weird and to not do that in public but I don't even realize Im doing it. I hate everything about my self and the way I act and I have thoughts about dying and not go out to social events for a few months but the next week I will feel beautiful  and love my life and want to go out and party. Everything irritates me. Now here's the stuff about my parents. I get really good grades in school and I have a job and I play piano (because my parents have made since I was 8-I'm currently 17 btw). I really hate sports (my parents used to force me to do track and field and cross country when I was younger and for weeks even months before I would worry nonstop about my races to the point that I tried to quit and when I actually would my parents would make me go back the next day and rejoin) and my parents constantly scream at me and get mad at me since I don't participate in any school sports. They also are mad since I'm not in any school clubs but nothing interests me (I'm not trying to be rude it really does) and I'm too scared to join. My parents say I'm lazy and don't do anything that helps anyone else and only care about myself- they say I only go to work because it benefits me but they have been nagging at me to get a job as long as I could remember (even when I was not legally allowed to work)....but once I got a job when I was 16 they didn't care and said all I cared about was money. They are very strict on me but not on my brother who doesn't give a shit about anything (fails his classes because he doesn't try) but plays sports. when I tell my parents about the fact that I can't sleep and that I always feel really scared and nervous they simply tell me to ""close my eyes and fall asleep"" and to "" just calm down."" Amazing advice! I recently told them (it was so hard for me to do this) that I would like to see a psychiatrist because all of these things have been happening to me for years (and they are aware!) and my mother SCREAMED at me telling me that I was being ridiculous and that I just worried for no reason all the time (yes mother that's the problem) and that I just wanted an excuse to be lazy and for people to feel bad for me. She said it was an excuse for me to cover up my ""bad and irrational behaviour."" She said nobody can help me and that it's my own problem to deal with myself. She said ""everyone gets anxious you just don't know how to control and handle yourself and you think people will feel bad for you and help you because you're too lazy to fix yourself"" and that she isnt going to waste her money. then my parents finished it all off by telling me to apologize to them?",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,Parents won't let me see a psychiatrist

I lost my previous job because of my depression and have been unable to find a job since last June, not only because of my lack of experience, but my town is suffering from a factory shut down that was housing most of the workers in my already small town. I can't drive due to social anxiety, and even if I could I don't have money for gas or a car. I've only had two jobs so far, one last year and one in 2013. The first one I lost because I intended to end my life and then ended up secluding myself when it didn't work. The second time I lost my job was because my S/O killed herself and in grief I tried to take my own life, ending myself in the hospital for an extended period.


I saw a therapist for about six months before finally dipping out. I dreaded having to go, and the medication I was on was just numbing me to the point I would sleep for 12+ hours a day and still being tired for the rest of the day. I was unable to function on a productive level.. or much of any sort of level at all. Then they wanted to bump up the dosage of the medication, and that's when I stopped going.


I don't really enjoy anything anymore and don't have the focus that I used to have. I play games to escape reality, but even the slightest disappointment in a game snaps me back to reality. If the disappointment is my fault, it just makes me feel even worse.


I pretty much live alone. I do live with my grandfather, but he only talks to me when he goes out. My grandfather is soon to lose his job due to the factory in town closing down, and we're already financially struggling.(Barely making enough money for food.) I don't really have any friends. That's not to say that I haven't tried making any, but my depression drove them off, or at least that's what I assume. My father left at birth and my mother is a drug addict who smoked all of her money away. I've been through stepdad after stepdad, a few who were abusive. My grandmother, who I felt was the only person who really cared about me, died in 2008.


Lately I've been unable to sleep. I don't feel like I'm living anymore. I lost a lot of weight last year (purposely) and was trying my best to be productive, but it seemed to amount to nothing in any sort of way. I haven't been able to speak to the few online friends I have lately, as much as I've tried. Some sort of anxiety trying to speak to even them lately, now. I think.. I'm pretty close to completely giving up, as much as I hate to say it.

After my last failed attempt at an intimate relationship, I have started reading about BPD (something that was fitting for my symptoms) and then NPD. I think I might suffer from the latter, as well as half of my family, and I am worried that I will end up all alone, in my high tower, having alienated everyone.

I am good looking (not the best, just good) and hypersexual, yet I mostly masturbate. I don't want a partner, unless I perceive him as really desired. In this case, one out of two things happen: either I earn his heart and trust and then alienate him out of fear that he will abandon me (thinking to myself ""Did I do that? Did I seriously do that? Why? Oh, at least it's my fault, so I can fix it next time... it's not that I am unwanted per se)""; or I win him, then I discover that he's not that great after all, and move on to the next victim without any real regard (""Suck it up, that's life"").

As I want to experience real love and intimacy with a partner I desire, I need help ASAP to change my shitty ways and stop manipulating and exploiting people.

My fears are comical: first of all, I fear that my ""partner"" might think about me in the same way that I think about him. Which is a totally disrespectful way, as an object (of desire), a mere function, an accessory...
1. He is MY partner, MY sweet-talking vibrator, MY walking erection (caused by ME, of course I can tolerate the though of his dick getting hard for another WOMAN... if he fucks goats, I'm OK with it), MY sweet smile (as long as it's ME making him smile) -
2. MY pet empath, MY mirror-mirror on the wall, I can shine my brilliance at him and watch him reflect it back on MYSELF with the vibrant power of thousand projectors. He HAS something I lack and desperately crave, he has empathy and can GIVE love, things I lack, but desperately need. Each and every time I think to myself that this time I will make right. But I always do wrong. The harder I try to avoid damage, the worse the damage is.
3. He's my personal audience, my faithful dog, dare he not be happy being faithful or being a dog, It makes me want to annihilate him. I am vindicative, but I don't take revenge, as I recognize that it won't help. But I have sworn revenge to many people, not only romantic partners, but anyone who disrespects me in any way.

I don't want to talk to people, I want to charm them and capture their minds and hearts. I pretend to listen and understand them, but only because I know that this captures minds and hearts.

I don't want to have sex with men, I want to demonstrate to them my passion and enthusiasm, my bedroom acrobatics, hook them and make them crave me, this is my fantasy. Actually, if I have to be fair, I am a pretty mediocre lover, unless I am enthusiastic about the partner (and myself, and how he looks on me). Then I become ... an enthusiastic partner, which is always good, but nothing very special.

After losing a romantic interest to my ego one more time I have decided that I can't afford this cycle to continue. Last time I tried to avoid manipulation and pretense, but things became horrible. I decided to ""show weakness"", but instead I raped emotionally the poor man and I feel awful. I vomited my insecurities and inferiority complexes all over him. 

Such horrible self-inflicted humiliation shattered my ego and I was a barely-functioning zombie for a while. I discovered a website, extensively dealing with NPD on the webs, and I think that it perfectly describes the way my brain works. The funny thing being, these things were always there, but I couldn't see them. My grandiose fantasies, my addictive behavior, total disregard for others, my addiction to flattery, including self-flattery (can't do anything about it - my own ego manipulates me into total submission).

My own version of empathy - I don't think about others, I will myself to think about others, then quickly start thinking about how I am thinking about others and how empathetic I am.


Even after discovering what is wrong, I just can't stop thinking about MYSELF and MY NARCISSISM. 


Professionaly, I am doing OK, I  love my job. It's the only thing capable of distracting me of thinking about MYSELF, MY PROBLEMS, MY BRILLIANT PERSONA, etc...


I can see how pathetic I am, or more likely, how just OK I am and how huge the gap between my self-image and real self is. It stings my ego, but that's OK.

The question is, can I learn how to love. Not just men, but my (imperfect) self, our (imperfect) world and to value this imperfect life. Or is this like diabetes, incurable?",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,I think I might have NPD

A little backstory: When I was 11 to 19, I was emotionally and physically abused by my stepdad (mom supported his abuse never stood up for me even blaming me for ""making him act that way""). At 19, I was kicked out and lived with someone else before something happened and I had to move back in with only my mom at 23. She and my stepdad had just began the divorce process (he walked out on her) so while she was going through (and still is) the divorce, she started behaving just like him, one minute being extremely verbally abusive, the next minute laughing and joking. 
I noticed I would calm down 100% (or so I thought) when she was happy and fine, always low-key worried about how long that'll last but then my stress would go through the roof when I noticed she was getting into one of her moods. 
So, a week ago, I completely cut her out of my life. Completely. Alright, that's enough backstory.

*So lately, I find that my mental abilities seem very much reduced. I'm not quick or sharp like I used to be, I stumble over my words a lot, switch up verb tenses incorrectly, I cannot remember song lyrics very well and I have developed extremely intense body tremors when I'm actively stressed about anything (it's like my adrenaline is on overdrive; my hands shake like a Chihuahua - my tongue even shakes).*
This has been building up for years but naively I thought that once the stressors (her and my stepdad) were out of my life, the symptoms would go away entirely, but now I realize that I've been so incredibly stressed out for such a long time that I am now functioning at what feels like 20% of what I used to be able to.

I'm angry and sad about all of this because it affects the way I interact with everyone - from friends to bosses - negatively and is hard for me to interact and function comfortably.

Anyway, is it possible for me to recover from this completely?  I do not want to take meds and I've been to therapists to no avail. 
I feel very lost at this point and maybe need to look at this in a different light. 
I'm not sure what I'm looking for really, I guess words of encouragement or whatever honestly. I just don't know what to do or where to start to retake control of my life and not feel like I'm at the mercy of my mental afflictions.

So I'm a relatively normal 19yo guy from Ireland. I'm in good health, I still live at home and I have a full time job.
The thing is though, I recently found out I have Aspergers Syndrome.
While that's fine and everything, it's made me rethink A Lot of what I thought about myself or knew about myself. 
For example, I've always been really introverted, shy and awkward. I still am to a degree, just less now than I was when I was younger.
So what that means nowadays, is that, I don't really go out with my friends or change my routine. I don't go clubbing or out drinking. I don't even leave the house on my days off. For a while now, it's just been home- work- home- work- home and then more work. And I don't mind that, except, I really feel like I'm missing out 
I keep hearing from my friends and co-workers all of these stories of stuff they got up to on nights out or about how they met some gorgeous girl or guy that they love meeting up to do stuff with. And I feel so fucking jealous of them. I feel like I'm missing out and that I'm wasting my youth.
It's even gotten to the stage where co-workers actually criticise me and tease me for not going out clubbing with them. And while I'm at work, most of the time I just laugh it off, but when I'm at home, I get really upset, simply because I get extremely anxious over ever having to change things up and not return home immediately from work.
The thought of going out has always made me feel uncomfortable and anxious, as does loud noise/ music or big crowds. But I really feel like I can't go on like this. 
At least i now know why these sorts of things always made me feel uncomfortable but still, things now have gotten quite unhealthy and unsustainable.
I mean, part of the reason I'm even making this post, is because I just had two weeks vacation from work and I literally left the house exactly once. Depression and feelings of severe inadequacy are starting to creep in and it's really starting to affect me and my self esteem, which, in all honesty, wasn't all that great to begin with.
Can anyone offer some advice or help here. I really hate missing out on what could be great experiences with my friends, but the thought of leaving the house or actually going out is extremely scary, uncomfortable and anxiety inducing.

TLDR: I'm a shy 19yo guy who is afraid of leaving the house (except for work) and after 2 weeks vacation from work where I left my house exactly once. It's really starting to affect my mental health as I feel like I'm missing out, my friends have been teasing me over it and it's been making me feel really depressed again.

Last year I was pretty messed up emotionally. My boyfriend was very loving and tried to be as supportive as he could be, despite being insanely busy trying to set up his career.


I was falling apart due to other issues in my life, and it really took a toll on him that no matter how much he loved me it wasn't enough for me to want to stay. I had suicidal thoughts, but if I really turn over the concept in my hand... it was just me wanting to get away for awhile and wanting to know if I'd be missed. I never acted on them, however I had a huge breakdown before I went out-of-state to spend time with my family to figure out where to go in life next.


I am the strongest and healthiest I've ever been due to getting my priorities in check. And my life is on it's way at the moment, but the biggest struggle is trying to gain the trust of someone who thinks sh** will hit the fan if I'm back in their life and kinda blames themselves for not being more supportive despite doing everything that they could? I'm doing a lot better now and that person thinks it's because they're barely in my life - but that's not the case at all, I'm working my ass off now and I also want to still be with them. When you know in your heart that things are vastly different compared to other times in your life mental health wise, and that you know it's gonna be okay, how do you build up something when the other person is fearful?


He still reaches out to me, he still loves me (confirmed by him and mutual friends), he even said he has reasons to believe that we're soulmates but he's scared of things reverting or the cycle continuing. He keeps me at arms length atm because he needs to focus solely on his work for the next few months, but wont let go of me, either. And I'm trying to do what I can to patiently breech the gap but I just wanna get some advice on it.


I'm striving for this, and I've gotten through worse in my life. I'm not clinging on to them out of fear of loneliness. It's a profound love, and I'm not giving up. So while I know some people would be confused about why I'm still working on it, I'm just looking for some advice about my actual questions. :)",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,How do I gain trust back of someone I care about after recovering from a struggle of suicidal thoughts?

My brother was taken to a general hospital in Melbourne (Australia)  after suffering a delusional (and likely hallucinatory) episode. There was little to no physical danger in this episode as far as I'm aware.

We're aware that he  habitually uses cannabis, I wonder about the possibility of his dealer cutting it with something less innocent like meth in order to bolster sales. (Savvy businessman, this particular dealer), and whether this could contribute?

After being doped to the eyeballs, he was seen as delusional and disassociative (no shit right?), and has been committed.

In his interests, I do believe he needs help, I only wish he'd gone off his own volition.

I've heard of people becoming victims of the system, always deemed unreleasable and staying for years. Does this happen?

What are the probabilities of actual recovery?

What likelihood is there that he'll forgive those involved in the committal?

This has been extremely hard on all involved, particularly his wife, children and our parents. Does anybody have any advice on how I can help this to not result in a family break down?

Some background info for me:

The summer between 7th and 8th grade, I was in solitary confinement in my room. At first I was not allowed to listen to the radio, draw, read, or use the internet. Two weeks into my confinement, I was given a radio, but that was all. After some time (maybe six weeks?) I was informed that I was allowed out of my room but for some reason I didn't leave. I missed my best friends birthday party, but no one believed my story about why. She was upset, I couldn't do anything to prove what I said was true, and after that I never really got comfortable in a friendship.

I have difficulties interacting with people at work, particularly superiors. It's like i just check out completely. 

I speak in a way that makes a lot of people think I'm lying, but I hardly ever lie. I can't actually remember the last time I lied.

I can't see a therapist because I'm off the student health insurance I used to have. I still have escitalopram but it will run out probably before I get insurance again. So now I'm wondering about other things I can do.


I have a community that I like now, a meditation sangha, but I just feel....not right. Not right in my own skin. Since junior high.

I'm bipolar (type 2), I've got anxiety issues, and grew up in an abusive household that has definitely had an effect on my behavior. I'm not in a place where I'm able to get professional help and I'm not sure I'll be able to anytime soon (If you need me to explain I will, but it's not really debatable). I'm not saying I'm a lost cause, I work on keeping myself in check. 

Part of me asking this question is because the thought came into my head that I've only ever clicked with people with mental health issues. I feel as though I don't deserve to be with someone who isn't riddled with issues like I am (or that they don't deserve to deal with me), but that brings up the dilemma of dating other people with issues. I know people are going to say ""everyone has issues"" and that's true, but the people I'm talking about are usually like me, stacked with problems. 

I'd also like for this to be a place where everyone can discuss their experiences in dating and possibly with how you dealt with what I am going through. I'd like to love again, and I have been pretty stable, it just seems like a recipe for disaster from a distance. 

Not sure if I've asked everything I needed to ask or said everything I felt like saying but this is a good start. Hope to find some insight at least.

For a long time I've have some bouts of depression but this time it's been clinging on and not really fading away. Hence, I seeked out professional help. I'm 17 years old and currently studying Maths, Chemistry, Further Maths (Self Teaching) and Biology at college (UK). Apologies if everything I mention below isn't structured properly.

To be frank, everything is just crap. I'm so fearful of the future that I feel as though I won't be able to do well on my exams that are coming up in May and June. I'm currently attempting to study but you know. Tiredness and Procrastination comes hits me up and Demoralizes me. I must admit, I used to be much more impulsive and automatically react to my suicidal thoughts. However, I feel numb, if that's the correct word to use. I'm aware that I feel *****y bit I just can't help but do nothing. It's like it's there and it's eating me up but I'm used to it. It's like even the most simple task like taking a bath will take hours for me to get ready and prepared.

I'm just so fearful of my future that I accepted that I will never be who I want and just become a failure to my self. Socially I have had people who have wronged me and I also questioned my sanity for it thinking whether was it my fault. But seeing them on odd days whereas the majority of the time I am alone does hurt to think that I'm suffering because of my own choices of life and career of wanting to become successful. I am however, very thankful for the people who I still have within my life. And not being bothered about the people who don't want to associate with me anymore. But it's that feeling where I'm not progressing anywhere and the thoughts of feeling like **** just comes up and eats you away I suppose. I usually would watch things away to distract me whenever I'm free. I usually do go gym daily with my friend to help each other out. I always think about the future and my dreams and yet I feel so far away from it. I am a hard working student but right now I feel as though all the effort I put in will be futile. I suppose it is bad enough to be having conflicts between religion and what you really think. Because to me, I think everything that has happened to me are interlinked.

In terms of my dream/career, I want to either become a chartered accountant or an actuary. I wish to do this by studying Maths in University in the likes of Exeter, UCL etc. And I want to travel around with my friends. But I feel that I won't be able to achieve that.

I was hoping that this year was the year that I will finally be able to bring my self back up and really focus and prosper on my studies. But it's seems like that doesn't seem to be the case. If anything it seems like the complete opposite and just making my self even suffer more by the choices I make. However, I am changing colleges next year to the one in my local town where I can be with my close friends. I feel selfish for asking this, but I guess I need some reassurance that everything will get better. I used to be so confident within my self and used to hear that voice within me that encouraged to strive for things. But now, it's just all of mixture of regret, sadness, numbness,anxiety. I'm worried that I will mess up miserably this year and won't be able to be accepted for next year and then my prospects and dreams have been tarnished. Although everything outside does seem to be going at a normal pace, it feels like my mind is being so slow and just foggy.

I guess that's as much as I can put through what my mind is. I will update more things as time goes on to keep on track. But I guess what I want out from this post is reassurance. It hurts being lonely to the point where even your self is somewhat against you.",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,In need of some reassurance as everything seems like a mess.

Anyways my best friend is very depressed and potentially bipolar (she's been meaning to ask her therapist but hasn't yet). She's also got anxiety and a few other underlying issues that I feel are best kept private.  For the past week or so almost any time we talk she mentions suicide. Last Thursday she actually went to my boyfriend and had him talk her down because I was at work and she didnt want to bother me.  It's very upsetting and I just want to be able to help.  This past Saturday we went to a party and as party goers do, we got drunk.  She got in a very bad state of mind and kept saying how she was done with everything and just didnt care. She almost resorted to sleeping in the car so she could freeze because she had no intention of helping herself. I had to get two of the guys there to help me bring her back in the house.  She says she's feeling better but she keeps posting on tumblr about her suicide note and the big goodbyes she's going to have with everyone. 


I know she told me even if she wanted to go to a hospital right now she wouldn't because her husband is coming home from the military next week, and she hasn't seen him in over a year.

Im 17 and in College at the moment, and recently something has changed with me, I don't know the cause or how to fix it. I'm hoping for some advice or pointers to what could be going on. Here are the symptoms:

- I'm finding it harder to sleep
- Solidarity is impossible for me for some reason I can't stand being on my own even for a second
- I'm finding it hard to control my emotions, I'm lashing out at my friends, family and girlfriend. I am a very measured person usually and would never lose control.
- I am finding it more difficult to multitask, concentrate and remember things (may be due to lack of sleep as aforementioned) 
- I am much less motivated, for work and hobbies
- most worryingly for me, I have started having 'black outs', similar to dissasociation except I literally just am not concious, I don't zone out or have an outer body experience, I am just aware and then time has passed and no cognitive processes have occurred. This was really scary for me, and has now happened 3 times.

So, I started college 2 years ago and am coming to my final few months. These past few months, I've had no motivation to do anything, I have no motivation to DJ or produce music, which I used to do on a daily basis. I can't sit down and work on a track without just getting bored and leaving it. I make excuses not to go to college almost everyday. I sleep in till late afternoon and stay up till around 5am almost every night. I came home drunk one night and told my Mum that I was depressed, although she brought it up the next day and I told her I was just talking rubbish because I was drunk. She always asks if I'm okay, and I know I have people round me that care. I've just been feeling incredibly low these past few months, however I have no idea why or how.

I also hope that my identity is somehow concealed (to some degree) so that no one in my day to day life sees this.

In 2014 I was diagnosed with having Major Depressive Disorder. I thought this was an accurate diagnosis, but I feel like that's not it. I literally think that I am insane. Some of my thoughts are not my own. My whole life I have had horrifying imagery and ""voices"" that I can't control. For example, I will be walking down the street, and I will feel the urge to push someone out into traffic. Like someone is telling me ""just do it"". It feels like I struggle to control my body, that one day I will lose control of it And I will hurt someone. I laugh at things that aren't there. I talk to things that aren't there because I get so lost in my head that I am in a fog, and then whisper my thoughts to myself because I'm so deep in thought that I don't realize I'm doing it. 

I have very narcissistic thoughts. I hate people that are better than me, because I'm a perfectionist and there's no reason that I shouldn't be able to do what they do. Which is why I hate myself. 

I will be happy for no reason, then extremely sad. I literally want to die. I don't see the point in living. 
I am not contemplating suicide. I was raised in a religious home. I am afraid that if I kill myself, that I will go to hell. This fear alone is more powerful than the urge to do it. I have dreams and imagery of myself dying. 

I am self-destructive. I sabotage my relationships with others, but then I feel sad because I'm lonely, and then I'll turn right back around and hate the people in my life. I can't get emotionally attached to people, or form connections or relationships. 

I am a peice of shit because I have no reason to be unhappy, but I am. My parents worked so hard to give me a good life, and yet I have never been able to be fully happy. I don't know why.

Most people think that mental disorders are just a murky layer on top of a normal individual. That might be the case, but not for me.  I feel like this is the normal me.

I went to her for absolutely everything, we had one of the best mother/daughter bonds you could have. I wasn't afraid to tell her anything, and never hesitated about it. 

I have really horrible anxiety and depression issues, which she would support me through. She also had anxiety/depression her entire life, so she knew how to help me with it. 

We would do everything together. Go shopping, help her cook, listen to music, take care of the house, etc. We were never really apart from each other. As i said before, we had an amazing bond. 

She had a past history of alcoholism, drugs, etc. This was all before i was born, but it was really intense. It almost killed her multiple times, she was in her late 30's/40's. Last year in may, it began catching up with her. She was diagnosed with liver disease. She was in an out of the hospital, continually getting worse for a month and a half, until she passed away due to pneumonia and liver failure. 

I can't get the memories from her being in the hospital out of my head. She was in the hospital 4 times, for atleast 4 days each time. It was horrible. I skipped all of my school work from the beginning of may until the end of school to be at the hospital with her. Out of the four siblings i have, I was the only one too visit. It made sense for 3/4, they were in another state 600 miles away. My other sister on the otherhand, lived with us. She just didnt feel like going. Im not going to get into that though. 

Ever since she passed my anxiety and depression has gotten worse than ever before. I've been in counseling since the day after my mother passed. The pain doesn't stop. On some days its easier sure, but it still hurts. it still destroys me every single day. My step father already moved on and fell inlove with a new girl, my sister took her money and ran, havent spoken to her in 5 months. I rarely speak to the rest of my siblings, and thats the only family i have. I don't have anymore other than them. I feel so fucking alone in all of this, i have no one to turn too who really understands this mental fucking torture im going through. This internal pain that hurts me so badly I want to vomit. It keeps me up until 6-7 in the morning because I can't get the thought of how life would be different if my mom was still here. 

My anxiety is constant. I have no break from it, Im constantly feeling on edge and worried and scared, for absolutely no reason. Its exhausting. 

My depression is always with me. I always have this heavy ache in my body that makes me want to get into my bed and never leave it. It makes me want to give up on everything I do, and drop all friend/relationships I have. 

I feel like im dying inside. I feel so empty and sad and hurt. Im not suicidal, but I dont want to keep going. I dont want to live my life without her here. She didn't even get to see me graduate yet. 

Im still so young and I havent even started my life yet and im so afraid to start it. Who am i going to go too when i need help with something? What about advice? Legal help, buying a house/apartment, getting married or having kids?? I don't have anyone. 
 It doesn't feel fair. Both of my biological parents are dead and i feel like i have no one too go too. I don't have a support system. I don't have anyone to talk too (except my therapist, and my LDR s/o) 

I know she wouldnt want me to hurt so badly for this long, but I cant help it. She would want me to smile and be happy and look back on our memories and be so thankful to have such an amazing mother as she was. Don't get me wrong, I am so beyond thankful she was my mom. I am so proud and happy to say she was my mom, and to share the memories with her, but know I cried so hard typing that. that i had to stop and remind myself to breathe. 

I've been told to just take it day by day, and let myself hurt and cry and be in agony, and i have been; It's just getting worse as the days go on, and I don't know what to do. 

I know eventually I will be okay. I know eventually I will learn to accept my moms death, and as much as it hurts me to type this, learn to live without her.  It just feels so far away. It feels like a goal that is absolutely impossible to reach, and I dont know if I ever will reach it. 

Im sorry if my spelling is bad or something, I've been crying and shaking and just a mess throughout typing this. 

Also, im just going to answer some questions I feel like im going to get:

Why not talk to someone at school/make friends?: Im homeschooled. All of my teacher are online, across the state.

TLDR: the reaction of friends, strangers and family to me talking about my past trauma was varied and surprising.

I have been blogging and pod-casting about my traumatic childhood and subsequent mental illness, and recently released a biographical book that goes into depth about the trauma that I faced in my fathers home.

Has was an addict, paranoid schizophrenic, chronic hoarder and drug dealer. Whilst he never directly hurt me, his clientele were a different story. Due to the neglect and trauma that I faced, I dissociated into my mind in an attempt to escape what was happening at the time. I was left with some significant mental issues that I am still dealing with.

I decided to share my story after I was convinced that it could help people to recover as well as to reduce some of the stigma around mental illness and trauma.

However, now that I have released my story and have been talking about it a lot. I have had many different reactions to it. Some of my friends that I never new were suffering have come out and started to share their stories, which is amazing and healing for all involved.

Strangers that have read my story have said that it is helping them to better understand themselves/partners who have gone through/are going through similar issues.

My family on the other hand have not been as supportive, in my book I talk about my father - the way I knew him. But some of my relatives have said that that 'wasn't the person that they knew'. Which feels like it is somewhat downplaying the things that happened to me.

I suppose that they knew him before he became my father, thus for them they now have to integrate this new information into their world view, which for some would be a hard thing to do.

I discuss this more here (podcast episode): http://www.zachary-phillips.com/realitycheck/016

I'm an EMT so I deal with depressed and suicidal people regularly, but never someone who directly effects me. 

My girlfriend and I are both in our very early 20s, we've been together for 2 1/2 years and she's never shown any signs of depression or any type of suicidal ideations, and as far as I'm aware, has no history of such. In the past week or so she's seemed a bit disconnected, hasn't responded to my texts as much. Today she barely responded to me at all and when we finally started talking she said she was feeling really depressed recently. I tried to get her to talk more about it, but she said she was tired and was going to sleep and that was the end of that. 

She lives at home with her parents still (as do I) and her dad is extremely overbearing on her, he might be a bit emotionally abusive as well. She is regularly called fat and lazy by him and he basically just shits on her daily about not having a job and never doing anything useful, always telling her she does nothing around the house (when she's the one who does almost everything). He never let's her leave the house to be with me, only if she leaves without him knowing. This then causes him to be even more of a dick to her.

For about 4 or 5 years now, I've been dealing with intrusive thoughts, or at least I think they are. I'm not sure. But i am swarmed by thoughts about violence, death, blood, and then I also have intrusive thoughts about eating nonfood items quite often. 

There's a possibility it is Pure O ocd, my sister who has OCD [severe] said so, but she said to make sure with a psychiatrist. I've decided that despite how afraid I am to reveal to her that I have incredibly violent thoughts every day, I need to bring it up. Whether or not they're intrusive, they cause me distress. I can't tell if i enjoy them, I can't tell if they're normal, and I can't tell if they're part of my [diagnosed] paraphilias or not. I don't like being so obsessed with these things and feeling compulsed to see blood. It results in feeling like I need to self harm every single day so that I won't hurt someone else. I only hurt myself because I need to see violence and release the anger trapped inside me. I have AvPD and PTSD so the expression of anger is incredibly difficult for me. The only way to express it is through bleeding.

She knows how much it bothers me and she tries to contact me and talk to me about it and she wants to go back to being friends, etc. but I don't even feel like talking to her.

It was shit simply put. I was in the dumps completely and believed there was no way out. Suicide was tried and failed and i grew an obsession with it. It was all i thought about every day and every night. Before bed I'd ask God not to let me wake up again. It was bad.

My ex left me and it sent me into a downward spiral. Anxiety and depression hit me hard and what made matters worse was that there was no reason that could have triggered it. It was not like i had a tough time growing up. In fact i think i have it pretty easy. Id hit cold sweats at the weirdest times, ill wake up in the middle of the night feeling like something is gripping my heart. So eventually i realized somethings wrong and I need help. Made an appointment with the mom and went to the psychologist and psychiatrist. The psychologist said sometimes a brain just isnt really good enough at making all the needed chemicals to keep your mood stabilized. I was working through some shit but it was not extreme. Just personal growing up stuff. Id get these voices telling me im not good enough and the all time special, some people are not meant to survive. Bipolar is a bitch. It eats yoy up from the inside and makes you believe youre a nobody. It really is like another being breaking yoy down constantly and it feels like youre at this war with yourself that you just cant win. But i did.

The psychiatrist gave me some medicine and i swear i fucking tripped for 3 days straight. I did not eat or sleep and had an INSANE manic episode. Like i spent 3 days and 2 nights writing out a huge ass business plan. Started coding . set up a website that next day and got some stuff running. And sometimes itll feel just overwelming so ill crawl into a corner and cry for 2 hours. The go back at it. Then after the 4th day i was just wasted. And slowly i was allowed to get my sanity back. The voices stopped. For the first time in years i felt stable. Tired. But stable. 

2016 was kinda crap. I failed my matric twice. And a semester studying and i heard just now that i failed my first semeater in something else. But its okay. Its life. It does get me down but I refuse to go down that hole again. I do get anxiety attacks. And i still do obsess with stuff. 

But with this i learnt THAT I AM GETTING ANXIETY ATTACKS and I do obsess with stuff. And thats very important. Because the psychologist helped me deal with with and gave me the neccesary skills to deal with it whenever it comes back. And now its easy. Some months are better than others but so be it. And i am not scared of it because i know im in control. This took 2 years. Its not long and i think i sorted it out pretty early so im lucky.

This is my testimony. Its not a big deal but its something I worked through and got through. And you can too. Its a part of life. Life has ugly sides and beautiful sides. You just gotta slap it so it shows the nice side every now and again. Its like a fitness skill. In the beginning it took me weeks to get over the anciety attack. Now it takes a few hours maybe a day.

It will get better.

It is hard.

We were together for 8 1/2 years until last September. She left me for a number of reasons; Mainly my mental health, and my looks. 

I had suffered from depression for many years and had self harmed before. But I was mugged in November 2014 which led to a diagnosis of PTSD as well as severe depression and anxiety. I remember the night it happened I called my partner to tell her. She had been partying and told me drunkly ""I thought you were strong we than that, why didn't you just fight them off"". Later she denied saying that. Since the mugging my mental health declined. I started self harming more often. Perhaps ever other month. Which used to be a lot for me. When she saw it she would tell me how ugly it was. And how she didn't want me to be seen with her. She had also been telling me about how I'd gained weight and looked ugly now. And how I dressed was embarrassing to her. 

She had a way of saying things in a way she could deny. She would tell me about how she wouldn't want to be seen going out partying with me because I'm no fun. And that she couldn't find me attractive because of the way I dressed. She was also distant for little to no reason. 

I tried to talk to her about it. But she would deny it. Saying nothing was wrong. I had to start travelling an hour into London to see her if I wanted to. My PTSD and London do not mix well and she knew that. But didn't care. Telling me I was just being weak. After a while she told me she didn't want me to touch we anymore. Because I wasn't attractive enough. I later found out she had been cheating on me. She would go to events and stay with her friends, sharing hotel beds with other men, telling me it was ok because her friends weren't interested in her. 

When she dumped me she cut off contact. A month after breaking up I decided to contact her. I wasn't coping and wanted to ask if we could just talk and try and be friends or at least have some resolution. I was not mentally stable at the time and she didn't want to talk. I attempted suicide after that for the first time. I left her a message (my suicide note). Sadly. I failed my attempt. Just throwing up everywhere for the night and having severe stomach pain for the next morning. I told her I was still alive. She called me a manipulative liar and called the police saying I was harassing her. Sadly, I think I was in a way. But I wasn't meaning to. I just wanted a 10 minute talk so I could understand and we could forgive and forget. And my mentally unstable mind couldn't cope with that. I attempted 3 times after that. Without telling her. 

I met someone new 2 months ago and decided to send my ex partner a message to say I forgive her and I'd moved on. Both me and my new partner had suffered with abusive ex partners and decided it was a good way to move on. After that message 2 or so weeks later the police arrived at my house at 6:00am and arrested me for malicious communication. My ex partner had made allegations against me. Sadly deleting her messages and only including mine out of context. I never sent anything malicious. I know this because several people have seen my messages in context and don't see anything wrong with them. But her false allegations were enough to get me detained for 21 hours. It was the scariest experience of my life. Silence I the cell. I wasn't allowed to talk to anyone. And I was eventually let out in Brixton in my pajamas at 2am or so. After that my ex partner messaged all my friends and family saying she would always be there for me. And has been continuing to message them. 

I just don't know. Yeah. I know I should've left things. I'm still mentally ill. I still want to attempt. I still self harm. I just want resolution but I'll never get it. I want her to leave me alone. And stop trying to ruin my life. I guess that's my brain dump. And everyone can now hate me as much as I hate me",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,There's no specific point to this. I just really need a place to brain dump

Got a lot on my mind right now so this could be quite a long post but will try and keep it as brief as I can. 

Here's the situation, what I tend to do is seriously overthink things to the point where things beat me down/eat me alive to the point where I can no longer really focus and enjoy my life. I lost my Nan last April, we were very close and her death was a very sudden thing. She was diagnosed with cancer in mid-March and then passed away at the end of April. We were very very close so it has been a very hard process dealing with the loss. With that being said, I really don't feel like I've fully grieved properly and it hasn't really quite sunk in yet, even though it's almost been a year. 
From what I remember, it was shortly after that I began to have these 'flashbacks' to these times, mainly that involved confrontation with somebody else. Although I've made up with the guys that I had these experiences with, I began to get some serious anxiety about the situations which actually happened a very long time ago. 

To give you more of an insight, I began to get anxiety about a guy that I had a bit of trouble with in a club. This was the most recent of the experiences that I speak of. We were both drunk and all it was was a bit of touchy-pushy type stuff and we actually shook hands and sorted it out that same night. Then maybe about 6 months later I began to get some serious anxiety about it, thinking that what if this guy saw me out again and tried to start trouble. This ate me away for a long time before I finally decided to just message him and clear everything up to make sure that we were cool. As expected, he didn't even remember and we sorted things out straight away.

Next up is something that I'm struggling with currently still. This thing happened about 5/6 years ago while I was in Year 8 (8th grade) I believe, basically my friend gave me a pair of trousers to wear after school and asked if I wanted to buy them off of him because they didn't fit him, I took them to try them on, played football and then ending up ripping them. I went to my friend's house after and then received a phone call from a bunch of my friends saying that they'd been up to my house to tell my Mum that I owed my friend money - they were with another guy that was kinda known as the biggest and hardest guy, and because I refused to give my friend the money for the trousers, they got this guy to confront me and then threaten me. 
The next day I've gave my friend the money and all of us just laughed it off, even the guy that confronted me. We've all been friends for many years, and pretty regularly go out together, whether it be drinking, playing football, and we're even planning holidays together. 

For some reason this scenario entered my head again many months ago and has been eating me away ever since but I really can't pinpoint why, especially considering we're all very good friends now, the guy apologised to me and it was so long ago and pathetic and meaningless. I actually saw the guy that confronted me a short time after it first re-entered my mind and I brought it up & we all laughed it off again and he hugged me and apologised again. But still it eats me away, I feel like I need to get him back in some way for making me feel so low but obviously that isn't something I want to do because he's my friend, it was so long ago and all in all it's just a pathetic and petty thing. 

As I say this has only began to really eat at me in the last few months, for the months and years after it happened it didn't even cross my mind so I'm very confused as to why it's bugging me like it is. Can anybody explain this?

Could this be some type of anxiety or something? It seems like I overthink everything I do now, like when I'm walking in the streets I sometimes feel like I've looked at someone in the wrong way (even though I definitely haven't) and I began to panic wondering what they might think of me etc etc. 

Appreciate any help guys, apologises for the long post. ",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,Can anybody explain this? Very confused.

I'm 28, living with my parents and severely autistic brother. For the past eight months my brother has been permanently living at home under my moms diligent care. This arrangement is all due to his last program causing him to have a nervous breakdown (that's another story). Because of what they did to him, he now displays destructive behaviors we've never seen before and his OCD has become much more prevalent (tapping walls, aggressive pacing, heavy breathing). Some days he needs to be constantly distracted and worked with in order to keep the OCD under control. 

I have my own set of mental health issues which have only been exasperated by his behaviors. I want to say that I've done everything to help my mom but I don't always step up to the plate. Mostly I try to help her by taking over her responsibilities so she can do more for him. But the way he behaves terrifies me at times and I'll find myself in a total panic. Especially recently. 

Days ago I broke down to my mom and told her that my anxiety is so out of control now that I can't eat or sleep. I dread coming home every day and obsess over everything that worries me while I'm at work. This has taken over my whole life and the only solace I get is when I drink every night. I'm ashamed that I had to confess all that to her but I feel as if I've reached a breaking point. 

Currently I'm low income so I only have medicaid. Maybe some of you can relate but trying to find mental health services has been very difficult and I don't know how to proceed next. I'm not sure if support groups are right for me. I do a lot better with one on one care. 

Part of me wants to move out but I'm not financially able to. Even if I were, I have entangled myself so much in their lives through my parents business and assisting with running my brothers online shop. I don't know how to balance my life with theirs. If I'm not at work, I spend almost all of my time at home. I don't have any friendships or relationships locally. My friends live out of state and have busy lives of their own. 

What's worse is, I know it isn't my brothers fault that this has happened. He used to be so full of happiness before they destroyed all of his progress. On the other hand, I now have a drinking problem because I can't cope with what's going on. Self harming behaviors that I haven't had in over ten years have returned. I don't know what to do or who to turn to. I hate making this about me but if this continues I'm almost certain my anxiety will become too unbearable until I can't deal with it anymore.

3 years ago, i stumbled on a reddit thread and heard about this thing called ""tinnitus"", a condition where you hear ringing in your ears.

Cut to about 6 weeks ago. I'm out skiing and all of a sudden this thought of ringing in my ears pops into my head again. I begin to obsess over it all over again, almost like deja vu from last time. Only this time, it hasn't gone away as easily. Every time I'm not focused on something, or even when I am, bam, it pops right back into my head, unwelcome and unwarranted. I don't know how to undo this mental pattern. Life has been miserable for me for the past month and a half (I'm not suicidal, but life hasn't been fun). I feel better and forget a little when I'm out with friends or working out, but otherwise I feel like I can't enjoy anything else in my life because of these thoughts.

I haven't been diagnosed with anything. But I know something isn't right mentally. For financial reasons as well as other reasons I put this off. I just am afraid. Because that label will be with me forever. That stamp of a two to three word label on me for the rest of my life. It's getting harder to live. By harder I mean sometimes you're driving and you're just wondering why don't I just ram off the gap between the rails and drop down. Because I've lost any friends I ever had because of this. My family doesn't understand. They think it's something you can snap out of, or that I'm crazy. I'm tired. I'm tired of pretending I'm ok. When clearly I'm not. The stigma of mental illness of any kind is horrendous. I didn't want to be just another person who rants here on Reddit but something inside me says maybe there are other people like myself who are a second away from typing out their Op's as well. I'm worried. And I'm sad. And I'm frustrated. It's like when you were in high school deciding what to wear and nothing seemed to look right. It feels like that except with my life. But maybe fortune is just around the corner for me. I've been saying that for a while now. Maybe it's just around the corner. Or maybe it's not headed this way. Anyway I just wanted to let anyone know that no matter what anyone tells you and no matter what you feel that there is probably someone in their car parked outside a McDonald's Binge eating this moment who understands what you're going through and if only he knew who you were he would do anything to help you. But this storm as been going on for a while now and it's getting harder to stand in the rain without an umbrella. But I gave the guy at the drivetru window a 20 buck tip and it felt really nice to know that at least I did something to help someone even if it was my last 20 dollars. He couldn't have been much older than me, probably a a freshman or sophomore in college. But maybe he'll be the one to find a cure for someone in the future, cause it feels like life is getting harder to wake up to and that's not a thought of suicide, it's just that I wonder a lot if I'm waiting for something good to happen that never will.

Basically, the meeting will be about my book, which is a short autobiography about my journey with mental health and addiction, and the things I want to do with the book. Some of those things include wanting to speak at schools, to youth, students, to patients, to political figures, etc.

I just wanted to ask this sub some advice for the meeting. What other things would you like to see in activism if someone local to you was speaking out about mental health and addiction issues. What advice would you give someone to be as professional as possible under these circumstances when they suffer from pretty bad anxiety (I got anxiety and bipolar and the whole friggin lot, been diagnosed with so many different things in the last 12 years).

I want nothing more than to be able to pull over on the side of a country road, bury my head in my arms, and let it all flow out. 

It's like my body never goes into the crying ""state""; I never receive any emotional release. And this may sound stupid, but I think my inability to cry is making me feel worse than when I *actually* had bigger things to cry about.

While they are all great and I'm sure effective in their own right, why is that more often than not... not enough? 

My aim is to create something that is not only a resource for those who are struggling with mental health but also for those who don't know enough about it, and I believe that you can never know enough about it. You can never know every story, every perspective, every experience that exists around the world... but we should try our best.

The first one was brought on by Real Time with Bill Maher. [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalVideo/comments/61x38r/timothy_snyder_on_tyranny_real_time_with_bill/) segment to be exact. 

I honestly believe that the U.S. is in a dire situation. I feel that an event like WWIII or The Holocaust or something similar is about to happen. The fear is absolutely paralyzing on some days.

I feel like the LGBTQ community is not a real community. I don't feel like I'm a part of it at all. I feel like if there was some legislation that the Trump Administration put out in the next 24 hours, that I would be helpless and not have another LGBTQ person to turn to if I needed to. 

The third crying fit came because I always try to find someone to talk to. When I find someone that I feel like I can talk to, I can't even get the words out of how I'm feeling. I can hardly even swallow right now just typing this out.

I want to know how I can get through to her and let her know I am here to support her through all this. I need to know what to tell her outside the realm of seeing a counselor, and how I can be a good boyfriend in this situation. We're also both college students, and that can be stress enough.

We've only been dating **3** months, and unfortunately she has never really had someone like me in her life before that really wants to help her. She's so dead set on taking care of herself and not ever relying on someone else to make her happy. That upsets me, because I want to be that guy that changes her mind, because I know how unhappy she currently is. I'd give her all the time it takes her to get comfortable with it. Because I know she doesn't ""need"" me to help, but I like the ""want""

I understand she is independent, but at the same time I want her to know depending on someone that loves her for support getting through hard times in life is not a bad thing. I don't know how to slowly make her realize that I can be that person she has never had before to help her get through things. She means the world to me, and I always want her to be happy.

**This is a text from her, and it really includes her feelings about everything, I know how long it is and I apologize in advance, but I feel like it is necessary to understand and diagnose the situation:**

> I don't know if I suffer with depression. All I know is it's always hard to wake up in the mornings. I lack motivation anymore. You have enough shit to worry about and I don't need to add onto your plate of problems. A part of me misses my dad the other part hates him. It has been almost 3 months since I've seen or even spoken to him. Before that it had been a couple of months and he texted me to tell me he loved me once. I've only heard him say he loves me once or twice in person. Growing up my whole life he said hurtful things to me. Threatening to call the cops when I wanted to leave when things were getting heated. Always worrying about if my parents were going to kill each other.

> I've wanted my life to be normal but it's always been anything but. I've always told myself to never rely on someone else to make me happy. I've always taken care of myself and that's how I plan to keep it. I've been beaten down my whole life and I only put up a front with how strong I am. I self harmed for way too long throughout grade school. I contemplated suicide more times than I'd like to admit. I wanted my life to end so badly. I spent countless days in my room crying my eyes out. I always felt like my parents didn't love or care about my feelings. They wouldn't ever listen to me when I'd be screaming and begging them to stop beating each other to a pulp. Sometimes I'd even get in the middle and end up getting smacked in the midst of them throwing punches at each other.

> I started growing up at a young age with responsibilities and had to take care of myself a lot of times. Now, I've been thrown out on my own with 0 support from anyone. I'm doing things on my own now while my life back home gets destroyed and messily put back together as always. Whenever I get upset I never want to talk about it. I hate talking about it. I don't care who it is. I prefer talking about things on my own time. I don't want to rely on someone. What I want is to finally be truly happy in life but anytime I get even a little bit of happiness life throws a curve ball that makes it all 10x worse. I literally don't know what to do with myself anymore. I never know how I feel or what I'm thinking. I lose emotions so easily but try to keep going and  sometimes it's really hard. My anxiety makes things hard. I stress and worry about everything. I wish it was something that would go away. I've never liked admitting to a ""mental health"" problem but I know they exist and I know I have them. I've always liked to view myself as mentally stable when I know I'm not as sometimes the smallest things send me over the edge and I just break down.

He still lives in his parents house, which he has lived in his entire life and he has a childlike mentality to a certain extent. As he's gotten older, his mental issues have gotten worse.

He's never had any adult responsibilities and has a very entitled attitude, thinking others should do things for him while he doesn’t do anything for anyone. His OCD makes him demand answers to ridiculous questions. eg. ""I didn't do anything wrong, did I?"" and he’ll keep repeating the question and gets enraged until he gets an answer that is satisfactory to him.

He has a girlfriend who he met at a support group for anxiety back in the 80’s, whom he reconnected with recently.

Suddenly (within the last 2 months or so) I've been having ... 'episodes'? That's the best word I can use to describe them, lol. These usually only happen with my significant other and not very often (every few weeks or something) but my most recent one was embarrassing because it was with someone who I didn't know very well.

I had a meeting with a member of a volunteer org discussing my interest in helping the organization out (kind of like a job interview). They were explaining something complex and I just wasn't getting it-- I asked them to repeat themselves and they didn't explain themselves very well because I'd phrased it badly. I KNEW what information I wanted, I just couldn't think about how to phrase it, and I got really frustrated as my mind suddenly just went completely blank, like I forgot how to think. Normally I'd sit and calmly think about how I wanted to phrase my next sentence, but for some reason I felt like I'd lost control and I made an obviously-very-frustrated flail-y hand gesture and went 'UM!!' while my brain rebooted. My lizard brain and body lost it's temper while my rational mind was like ""wait no just hang on, chill for a sec!"" The person now probably thinks I'm just a total weirdo with an awful temper.

It was so embarrassing. She obviously noticed and told me 'its okay!'. I'm normally pretty cool headed but this sort of outburst has been happening more frequently and I'm really worried it's going to affect upcoming job interviews and things like that. It usually happens when I'm in a high pressure or high stress situation and suddenly pressed for information.

Some background on my circumstance:

My parents have invested on building a house that costs almost a million (Yes, Australian land is expensive af) in which they plan to pay off by working at their own business for another 10 years or so. However, issues arose from borrowing money from the bank for the deposit and I was obligated to help my parents out by giving half my savings to them.
This made me think that my parents have no plans for retirement as they already have been working for 10 years non-stop paying off the business. 
I was thinking.. I was never good at studying at university. 
Why am i forcing myself to keep studying when Its not getting me anywhere?
Wouldnt it be better if I just found work for a year and helped my parents out or keep studying ?

I can't really seem to ever explain my situation to anyone properly. I live in a overcrowded house which is used as a storage for the business. I've lived 10 years either sleeping on the floor in the living room or a bedroom when my grandma was here. I sleep in my own bedroom now so its gotten better. 
I miss having a proper living room, i miss having space to walk around in my house, i miss feeling safe, i miss coming home to a homely cooked meal from my mum. I miss having light in my house, (my parents get paranoid someones going to look through my window so they always leave my blinds closed), i just hate it when i go to friends houses and see how spacious and perfect their house is despite how old or small it is. 

My point is; i'm incredibly depressed and seem to be triggered at every little thing i see and hear from day to day life and from tv/anime. Thus i can barely focus on my studies and up drowning in my own thoughts the more i try to study.
I'm not allowed to have any friends over and csnt remsmbsr the last time I've had guests over. Even if i did bring them in, my older sister will snitch on my parents or if shes not at home there'd be cameras my parents can access from work.


I'm not entirely jumping out of the college route since I can defer my course until next yr. 
I was offered Computer Science in Mid Year Intake and currentlt study Business/Arts both i can defer until whenever really. Just thinking about studying gives me PTSD. i just wish there was some other way to get to know my course other than the traditional lectures and tutorials.

Then again, i tried working for a week on the holidays full time which made me depressed to .it seems everything i do causes me to be depressed or some sort even just being out with friends, playing in a band, being in class, being at home especially. 

I have tried working in  hospitality roles but its too social for me.

So for my whole life (I'm a 17 y/o guy) I have always loved girls and I've crushed on them and tried but never succeeded until this previous November. I had a relationship for a month and I was happier than a kid on Christmas, but half way through that relationship one of my friends (girl, just clarifying) caught my eye in a way we could not ignore. In the meantime it is mid December and my girlfriend at the time breaks up with me because things were getting ""too serious for her"", which crushed me, but not all that much because i had that friend, lets call her Amber to make things easier. So Amber and i start talking a lot (initiated by her) and we turn out to have so much in common. I really like her. We see each other everyday at school. I know I'm only seventeen but i felt a real connection, i could see a future with her. After our first out of school adventure she says we're just friends. OUCH. So i tell her i like her a lot. She says ok and our friendship persists.I start to see a little HOCD pop up here, i was thinking so much about why she didn't like me. We hang out again after talking and at the end we hug and i whisper ""I love you"" because I did, and to this day do. She told me the day after that that was the safest and happiest she had been in her whole life. I thought i was good. Everything was good. I go to everyone of her soccer games. On valentines day i give her a hand made card and went to her game, it was 26 degrees and i was frigid, but it was worth it to me. Everything was good until the next night. She went off on me and said she needed space. I gave her space but she came and talked to me anyway. So problems persist and I never treat her bad, but she treats me like she hates me sometimes. She would tell me she loves me as a friend but not act like it. Sometime during this i go on a run and come home and have a stress attack and end up in the ER. Anyway it's the day of her last game and the day is going pretty alright, until i see a snap from her to her best friend who i could see as being lesbian. i was keeping this girls streaks. Amber had wrote ""Good night, i love you so much babe"". I thought it was just friend talk so i go up to her friend (lets call her Jane) and ask about it. She says they're dating. She says she's serious, then 5 minutes later says she's joking. I freak out because this girl i love could have been persuaded into a relationship with her friend. I talk to Amber. She says it doesn't matter and i shouldn't worry about it because i'm just her friend and that she doesn't wanna talk about it. I freak out more. At this point I have a 101 degree fever because I'm so nervous. After her game she's pissed and runs past me to Jane. I wait 30 minutes to talk to her. She said it was a joke. I tell her that's not a joking matter but she didn't care. Anyway after that i start to question everything and develop a strong case of HOCD. I'm constantly struggling my whole vacation worrying about it. It doesn't help that it seems that my sex drive had disappeared. I have done my research and what i have come up with is that it could be depression induced. Just for everyone to know before all of this i was never stressed, angst, or depressed. I've been trying to move on but its hard because i have real feelings for one person. Also for everyone here to know, I have always liked women and the thought of me being in a homosexual relationship was repulsive, but now i'm in a constant state of worry about it and I know i'm straight so i don't know why this is happening. I still only get aroused to women, which rings true to who i am, just not as much randomly throughout the day. Can anyone out there help??

I've learnt to manage it pretty well, but I still get irrational fears and intrusive thoughts here and there. I also feel as though my self esteem and motivation are just gone completely. 

I have no job because I quit my last one because of anxiety and OCD and since then I've been doing enough to get my parents and girlfriend off my back about getting a job (attending an interview here and there, occasionally applying for jobs). I have money because I have a savings account.

Yesterday I had an interview but I just didn't want to go at all. I was pacing back and forth deciding whether to come up with some excuse or just push myself and go. I eventually decided to go but everything started going wrong. I was running late already and rushing so I felt anxious and I had to go to a city I don't know very well. I got held up in traffic and then a bird hit my car and died. It all built up and just tipped me over the edge and I let out a huge scream in my car. I sounded like a nutjob. I started breathing heavily and just pulled up and called my girlfriend and told her I wasn't going. I think that's the angriest I've ever been.

I felt like I'd gone insane or had a mental breakdown or something, and since then I've felt awful. I feel like I'm mentally ill, like I'm dangerous and might pop off at any minute and shout at someone or hurt someone I love, but I know I wouldn't because I've never hurt anyone in my life. I feel like a different person, like I'm just completely lost and hopeless. I feel pretty depressed now and just very anxious and nervous. Like I'm just wandering around with no purpose.

I have no idea what to do. Every time my mental state gets bad, I think about going to counselling but I know there's a long waiting list so by the time I go to a session I'll be better anyway. I have no idea what's wrong with me and how I went from being a normal kid with ambitions and goals to a practically insane man in about 4 years.

But I just have some thoughts from my experience. Not to make a specific complaint. But to share the struggles I've faced over the last decade almost. 

As a quick backstory. I got into a relationship when I was young. And that relationship lasted 8 and a half years before it eventually ended 7 months ago. At first it was a happy relationship. But the problems mounted. I noticed we argued a lot. Often my ex would say something hurtful. When I would mention it she would get upset at me and it would end in me apologising. I shook this off and eventually just accepted that it must've been me. Among other things she would attack my personality and interests as well. Whenever I found a new thing I liked. Apparently I'd ""changed"" and would be chastised until I stopped doing that thing. And if I ever created or did something I was proud of (music, academic achievement etc) she would pick it apart until I felt worthless. This kind of thing went on for years. She made me feel ugly. I loved, worthless, and isolated by the way the emotionally abused me and guilted me into getting her way, even going as far as o secretly convince my friends behind my back that I didn't want to spend time with them anymore; ruining several childhood friendships. Of course there are many other examples I could give of how she would manipulate me but I wanted to just briefly describe the way I was treated. Even her family and friends joined In From time to time. 

All of this led to a large amount of mental health issues. 

What upsets me recently is that after all of this. Only one person I know believes me. Most people if I try and explain will say a multitude of things to me ""why didn't you just leave"". ""I wouldn't  put up with that"" or the classic ""I doubt that's true"". And sadly. This is how I'm treated. Not just by people I know. But by professionals too. According to almost everyone in my life it's somehow either my fault or I'm lying because ""women don't do that sort of thing"" yes that has been said to me. By a professional. 

I tried to find support only to be blasted with thousands of facts about how abusive men are to women and how many women suffer. Honestly I'm glad there's so much support out there. But even dedicated sites to help men deal with domestic above seem to be plastered with demeaning adverts about how men need to know how to treat women properly. I've never seen a single advert saying anything about a women abusing a man In Any way. And as much as I'm happy for the support towards women. It's so so harrowing to feel that you are blamed and prosecuted. Of course I know many men and women likely feel how I feel and are often
Blamed when in truth they are innocent.

My brother is 17. He's always had issues with talking. He can talk, but he has very selective talking, and clearly has anxiety, and probably something up with him, I don't know if it's depression or what. 

 


I moved out a year ago. Back then, he was doing really well. He was doing really well in school, he seemed a lot happier than he used to be. But about 6 months ago he's just been getting really bad.


But now his anxiety has came back, but this time a lot, lot worse. He struggles to speak to any of his siblings (including me), his parents, grandparents etc. He might say a nervous ""yeah"" occasionally, but that is about it.


He is hardly eating anything anymore. I noticed and I said ""[Name] your not eating that much today, do you not feel well or something"". He said ""no I'm fine"", and his mum said ""no he hasn't really been eating much for the past couple of months"". Am I going crazy or is that some sort of red flag? My mum just didn't seem to think that was not normal.



When I was 17, I had a part time job, earning money, revising for my a-levels, working hard. He won't work (I think it might be anxiety related), he has never even considered revising for his a-levels, he stays in his room pretty much all day and sleeps during the day.


I said to my mum about if she things something is up with him. She just said ""he hasn't said anything, so I'm sure he's OK or he'd say something"". He has such bad anxiety, of course he isn't going to say anything.  

I know how teens think they are right about everything. However, in this case I genuinely think his mum is wrong and he's right. My mum has always said she's right about everything. I can remember she always used to do that as well, and she was always wrong. She'd say ""it's X that is the problem, you are just making excuses"". So I stopped saying anything to her. I think it might be the same in his case.



I go round to my parents probably once or twice a week. Each time I go there (normally around 4PM) he is always asleep, which cannot be normal. He will come down, might sit down on the sofa but just not say anything, might occasionally say something but I can tell he doesn't want to be there and he's really nervous. He will play on his phone, but all he's doing is just scrolling on the home screen and just making it look like he's doing something. I don't want to be rude, but he doesn't really have any friends so I doubt he is texting anyone.


He's close to being kicked out of his college. From what I've heard he bunks off constantly, he's very close to being kicked out and several months behind on assignments. My mum will just tell him he's lazy and he's causing his own problems. But I disagree with her, completely.






I don't know if I am over thinking it, but I'm worried as my older brother has mental problems, and my parents denied anything was wrong with him, and he was diagnosed with mental health problems. He became a drug addict at 19, and was very close to being homeless by 25. I don't want my little brother to go through the same thing.

We had been dating for 7 months prior to us breaking up in January. The reasons were she was distraught over her prior ex which bled into our relationship and then she took a job in another state. I continued to keep in touch as a friend. We had an argument on Monday of some pictures I posted on facebook of her, and her alone, that I thought she wanted.  
So today I got a set of text messages from my ex which in conjunction to our previous talks led me to believe that she was going to kill herself. I ended up calling her landlord who didn't call me back and then ended up calling the police for help. 30 minutes after I got off the phone with police she called me completely hysterical and after 15 minutes was able to calm her down enough to understand what she was saying. Another 30 minutes went by and the police showed up.  
Based off of what she had texted me, what she told the landlord, and what she told the police themselves they made the decision to take her to the hospital. The last thing I heard on the phone before she hung up was the officer saying ""You can voluntarily check in or I can involuntarily check you in"" and then she hung up.  
At this point I am at a complete loss as to what to do. I know that right now she is at a hospital in her state. I hope she is at a minimum being cooperative.

I also had zero friends for most of 5th grade, was lethargic, and constantly fighting off tears. Somehow every single adult in my life chose to ignore this. 
 
Middle school was also pretty shitty for me, but the first two years of high school actually went pretty well. Now I might actually be at the lowest point in my life (it's tied with 5th grade), but my parents (mom specially) pretend like I don't have and have never had any problems with anxiety and like to lecture me on how I have nothing to be stressed about and how much worse adults have it (my mom also likes to talk about how she has the lowest stress job ever, so that doesn't even make sense). My mom also sometimes deliberately gives me anxiety attacks (which can last hours) when shes mad at me, and then she yells at me for having the attack. 

Lately it's been getting unbearable, and there's been times where I've had anxiety attacks at school (5 times in the past 2 months), so I've been looking into buying myself some medication to help me cope, like things for anxiety attacks and things to help me go out and be social and gave fun in situations where I want to have fun instead of hiding in the bathroom to cry the entire time. 

No matter how much research I do my friends hate the idea and honestly seem pretty condescending telling me to get ""real"" help, knowing that my parents would never allow it. Honestly, I'm not sure what else to do? My grades keep getting worse and worse, every year it gets harder and harder for me to focus and I can't even bring myself to care enough to do any assignments. I've had enough shitty grades that, even if I magically manage to improve them to straight As my last year, I still won't be able to get any scholarships and it feels like my entire future has been thrown away by my laziness and apathy. 

And the more I look back on how I was, the more pissed off I get that nobody tried to help me when it was so obvious. I hate who I am now as a person and I'd trade it for literally anything else, and if my parents didn't have the idea of mental illness so much I might actually have some self confidence and a future ahead of me.

Throughout my life, I have had similar issues with those closest to me struggling to understand or even believe the extent of my suffering. 

It was almost like my word (that I have a mental illness/issues from my past) was not believed on face value. Perhaps it was because I did my best to hide my symptoms and function as ‘normally’ as possible. In the past, I didn’t want any attention to be drawn to my condition.

This is a serious issue, as a lack of belief that someone is at risk could be potentially life threatening if some poignant signs are not noticed and addressed.

I was contemplating why people don’t believe that others have a mental illness, and came up with this post. I hope to help those with a mental illness see why others potentially don’t believe you, as well as help to reduce some of the stigma around mental illness as well.

In this post we want to discuss items that will help obtain adequate authorization for patients within your behavioral health facility.

One of the key aspects of pre-authorizations and utilization reviews is having well rounded masters level clinicians trained specifically in these processes. Clinicians are not trained in their masters program to manage insurance in any shape way or form. Unfortunately, this puts the majority of clinicians at a disadvantage for obtaining adequate authorizations for patients. 

In order to assist with ensuring competency in your clinician you must have a specialized training program in place that will educate them on how to affectively obtain authorizations as well as continued stay reviews.

Have one of your clinicians dedicate time to reviewing and understanding patient placement criteria among the different insurance payers is a must. Keep in mind not all insurance carriers utilize ASAM placement criteria. You must familiarize yourself with the criteria and make sure you know the requirements prior to attempting to obtain authorization. 

The most overlooked requirement in the authorization and utilization review process in behavioral health is the documentation. Many authorizations are done over the phone with the clinician treating the patient making the call to the insurance carrier and describing medical necessity to the care manager. You must document your patients case in great detail in order to provide a comprehensive picture that defines medical necessity for the specific patient. Without having adequate documentation you may be placed in a position in which you do not receive compensation for services or potentially receive more authorization denials lacking information. 

This includes documenting detailed clinical and medical notes in the patients record. Insurance company care managers have a job to do with ensuring the patient in fact needs the level of care that is being proposed. If you do not have adequate information to build a case showing medical necessity you will experience and increase in authorization denials as well as claim denials after authorization is obtained. 

Education and documentation are among the most problematic pieces to authorizing patients. Create proper policies and procedures within your behavioral health billing organization surrounding education and effective documentation.

The tedium has shot my productivity because, instead of focusing on the work, the challenge has been pushing myself over that boredom hump, where the mind has slowed and thickened like molasses. I've stopped caring at an emotional level about whether I'm jeopardizing my job by distracting myself with just about anything else, and the distraction has won out over time spent on work. I feel agitated and hostile when I'm trying to focus on work, that it's an unwanted imposition on me. What's at stake is a high salary and my professional reputation.

I'm actively seeking a new job that's a better fit, but financially I'd rather not have an income gap until then. I figure I might just have to take a small hit to my professional reputation but write it off as a mismatch of expectations.

In the mean time, to try to cope with the boredom, I listen to music at work, which isn't enough to get me to focus, and work out and socialize after work. I could also spend some of the work day learning things that would have higher career value and are more interesting although this is technically time fraud.

Excuse me if this isn't the place to ask about this. I'm in the process of getting into making a short film about eating disorders and body dysmorphia. It's being adapted based on the thesis I wrote last semester about the steroid user community, and in my research I ended up focusing a lot on the mental health aspect of using those compounds.  Namely body dysmorphia and how it effects these guys and how they perceive themselves. It really resonated with me because I was able to tie in my own problems with anorexia which I developed at a young teen and my struggles with binging now.

Now we're 18m 19f respectively and things have a different tone which is great. We're supposed to be meeting soon. 

Except, tonight she wasn't back from work at her usual time, so I start to get paranoid and I sent her only like 3 PMs, now see I thought yep fucking her ex. I mean when we were younger she used to have boyfriend after boyfriend, and she let me down a lot, with her unstable mood, unpredictability... I don't mean this callously, we both have our problems... For the most part we work great together, we're healthily codependent. She has improved so much though more than me, everything now proves to me that I should trust her, except I revert back, reversion is something she is strong enough not to do.

Turns out she was stuck in traffic for 1hr and a half. We know each other very well, she knew why I felt paranoid, I could feel the fury in the tone. So currently I have left her alone, appologised with equal intensity to her anger. I'll see if we can discuss it rationally a couple of hours later, we are good at that.

I got so stressed I feel like my entire personality has changed I need to stop this, for her. It always shifts between extreme sincerity to the opposite, as a coping mechanism, I have to keep being me. I keep hearing the distant sound of a child crying in the back of my head, is that me? My emotions are a mess, I'm a mess still, I keep trying to convince myself I have changed but I haven't really, I'm never going to feel happy.

I also can't shake the feeling that I'm misleading her about who I am, I'm sadistic, she knows, she knows how intense it is, she knows about my past, she knows how dark my personality can be, yet she trusts me, she enables me to an extent. She's pretty wonderful haha, she shares a similar sentiment about me too, I try my best to look out for her and we're a couple of ridiculously empathetic people who pick up on far too much for our good. Sometimes it clouds our judgements makes things blurry.

I think we are far too intense we burn ourselves out before anything can happen usually.

Just what do I do? how do I stop my mental health problems from letting her down, I promised her I can deal with the paranoid/controlling urges, she trusted me so why can't I trust her? I want things to work between us whatever happens. It's early days but I noticed I am trying to consume alcohol whenever I can without arousing suspicion, constantly  wondering why should I care about her?! Just want to run away and disappear or do stupid stuff. Fuck I love her and I feel so uncertain.

EDIT: We talked (talking) I have my warm fuzzy feeling back, I think I can keep myself going. Plus she's cool, she has an organic brain problem migraines other related issues, so I mean she got lost panicked her brain scrambled itself, so did mine in a different way, shes back, feeling better.

My personality changes so much and even though I am visibly very different (Such as today people have quite literally asked what is wrong with me) unlike MPD I am always aware of these personality changes. I have always indenitifed it as masks. I want to see a psychiatrist for long standing problems with these issues and some other personal issues with have (I should have done multiple times in the past, but I have had a pretty shitty past for when iit comes to getting help). I am only really hitting the surface of what I usually go through usually with these issues, there's alot more but I am really not in the mind set to go into the darker details of it. I cannot control these personality changes when I go through them and I have quite a few which I indetify with. Like I said I am not sure if this is MPD because people with MPD usually go through amneisa with their identity swaps. I don't know, I want to know if anybody can give me any idea of what this actually is?  Like I said I am going through quite a big swap right now, like this is the most apparent one of my personality changes have been in a while. Maybe you'll notice later if I go back to normal that I come across as a little different. As I said I am aware of these personality swaps, I just can't control them, if that makes sense at all?   

So yeah if people can give me any clue of what is going on, much would be apreciated. If not for me, then maybe for others going through similar issues. there's very little online on this matter and I think having a reddit to explore and explain this sort of stuff more would be very valuable to those who need help on the matter.

I have a bizzare issue running from childhood. I am sensitive to fabrics, tightness, and I can only wear sweat suits and so I look a bum. People want me to dress well, in suits etc, but I experience extreme discomfort if I am forced to do so.

I thought it was phobia and I have tried to do exposure therapy on myself, I read CBT (thoughts <-> actions <-> emotions) and mindfulness books, and it doesn't seem like it's helping that much. I googled and found it it some kind of sensory processing disorder. It's a bizzare problem. Can you please advise? I am looking for everything under the sun.

 I am a 19yo male living at my parents houses (parents are separated so I'm doing 1 week/1 week) and I go to college full time in Computer Science. Basically, I consider myself worthless and a waste of my parents time. College hasn't been great, I spent my first 2 years failing a lot of class before switching program last year and going in Computers. My last semester was the best one I had, I was motivated about my new studies, failed nothing, but now I feel like I'm back at square one. I'm failing a lot and somehow I can't push myself to study more. In other words, I lost every single bit of motivation I had last semester and now I feel like I'm headed nowhere. I am even worst at home. My room is always a mess, I don't help with house chores, I barely know how to cook anything, I don't talk much to anyone, go to sleep around 1am to 3am week days... I would love to be a better person, to be the one to initiate talks, to help my mother or father at home, to lose my time everyday on my pc and actually do something useful of myself, to be a decent human being, but somehow I always an excuse to not do anything. I'm a mess, I'm probably getting kicked out of home once my parents learn that I'm failing school again, I don't deserve my girlfriend's love, tbh I don't deserve anything.

Get up and do something about yourself, stop playing games, stop doing nothing, I hear that a lot from my parents and I understand fully what they mean. I always tell myself, people have it worst than me. I'm not suicidal (sometime joke about suicide, but nothing more than that), I don't have severe anxiety, I have people that care about me and wants what's the bets for me.

The relationship went as expected when involved with someone like this, and as you can imagine it involved a lot of negative or just plain weird experiences. However, as more of her illness revealed itself, it had become a sneaking suspicion that there was a second personality developing or forming which ultimately culminated into a very surreal experience with her. From what I understand, genuine DID cases are extremely rare, so I've always wondered if I had a run in with her other personality or if she was just lying.

To briefly set the stage: I was picking up my things from her apartment, she was not supposed to be there. She ended up coming home unexpectedly and basically flipped out on me. Yelling, screaming, hitting me...I'm sure you get the gist. I did not hit her back, but tried to calm her down instead, and this is where it gets weird, it was like she didn't know who I was...literally. I tried to calm her by telling her, ""Hey, hey it's me..."" and bear in mind we had been talking and joking around just a couple hours earlier, but she just looked at me and it was like she was staring at a stranger... then started screaming for help. Like full-volume, ear splitting screaming. This reaction basically scared the crap out of me. I still try to get her to calm down, but...and here's the second weird occurrence, when I was trying to calm her down she suddenly got really mad at me for saying her name, and she said, ""Why do you keep saying that name!! Taylor, Taylor, Taylor!! Stop saying that name!"" I remember this, because I honestly didn't know what to say at the time...because Taylor was her real name. (I've changed it for obvious reasons) Later I found out that she started asking people at work to call her by her middle name Maddie, and started putting Maddie on accounts of hers like, phone bills and hulu, in addition to having her neighbor call her Maddie. Anyway, at another point in the conversation she stated that she needed to go to the doctor so I'm like, ""Sure, if you're hurt let's go."" Then she starts screaming about how I'm trying to kidnap her and that I'm really not taking her to the doctor. Again, I pretty much just stood there shocked because my thinking is like, ""We were just joking around a few hours ago, wtf?"" It was genuinely like she didn't know me at all.

So there it is in a nutshell. Sorry for the long post, but this was something I've always wondered. Please let me know what you guys think.

So very rarely will I get this overwhelming feeling of just something so sick and vile that it'll make me want to throw up. It'll turn my stomach into knots and make me uncomfortable until the feeling goes away. It has been happening since I was really young and it would mostly come from specific nightmares that I cannot remember. I'll wake up with the feeling and not be okay for awhile. It's almost a dirty feeling as well and it just sits in my throat the most. One time when I was in my teens, I was getting sexual with a guy for the first time and I literally had to stop, get dressed and leave because the feeling came back. I had the feeling today in the first time in about a year and I still do not understand what this means or what it is. It'll happen randomly, nothing I can think of triggers it. I still don't know what dreams I'm having whenever I wake up with the feeling. It's like my brain won't let me know..? 

Anyway is this a possible anxiety issue? I have no clue to where this stems from but it affects me so bad that I will be on the verge of throwing up. Thank you all so very much and sorry if this is confusing! 

Edit: Oh I wanted to add that I can't even be intimate whenever this feeling comes up. I need alone time or it'll get worse. I've also never been sexual abused or raped.

I went to jail for only 10 days, not a big deal at all, it went by quick. I mean it sucked but comparatively 10 days is nothing. Being in there, I thought that as soon as I was out I would want to be busy and out of the house all day and living life to its fullest because that's all I thought about in there...I made all these plans for what I would do.

I think about it when I see the signs of my parents aging. White hair. The date. Everywhere I turn someone is saying something that reminds me of my own and my parents mortality.

Today I completely broke down. I told my Mom why I was having the panic attack and she dismissed it. As did my Dad. They don't understand. They tell me to think of something else. But I literally have nothing else in my life worth thinking about. Nothing to look forward to. No prospects. Nothing.

It all started when I told a close friend that I liked her, but she didn't like me. The next day she revealed that she liked another friend of mine whom had told her he liked her many times, but before hand everyone those geht it was a joke. She told me that they were dating. 

The jealousy took over me, but since she was my close friend I told her about it. She was the most supportive and helpful person ever and helped so much on moving on, I later told the friend she was dating too and he even felt guilty for a bit because I was his friend. I knew that they are in love I am perfect fine with it, because
I'm happy that they are, I don't want to ruin their relationship because of me. This ended up making me trusting and respecting here more, and she had helped me with so many other problems that I don't know how to thank her, it brought us closer as friends and she is now my best friend.

But the thing is the jealousy is still there, and she has been trying her hardest to help me, and it has helped me a lot and I have gone a long way since then.

When they are kissing or doing things that couples do, the jealousy comes back even if I want them to be together. When it happens, the jealousy first comes over and I feel I'm dying inside of me, I try to distract myself and it works enough for me some times to forget about the jealousy and move on, but it sometime doesn't, then the guilt sets in. I used to bash myself for it and give myself a even lower self esteem, but she had helped me with that and it's mostly gone.

I have found that meditation stops the jealousy form coming up, and helps get rid of it after I feel jealous, but I want not feel jealous when I'm around them. I want to be happy for them and not feel depressed when I'm around them. I want to learn to accept that they like each other, that she doesn't like me and that I just need to move on and live my life. I just want to be happy with my friends.

I recently found out that she blames herself for hurting me, even though it is completely my fault for liking her in the first place.

After agreeing, she said she recalled repressed memories about his coaxing me to do cocaine at age 8, being a serial murderer, going to jail and needing to be bailed out by my aunt, etc. All of this is categorically untrue, and I was hoping it was an April Fool's joke. As many faults as he may have, he has been a loving father and worked hard to provide for our family while we were growing up.

Unfortunately, it is incredibly unlike her to pull a prank like that. 

Last I spoke to her, she said she was on her way to see a trauma therapist and I told her she should see a neurologist as well. I wasn't sure how to respond since to me it sounded like she was having a mental breakdown, and I was afraid any of my attempts at reason would exacerbate whatever was happening in her mind.

Essentially I'm wondering if anyone would know if I'm acting normally or if I should go see someone like a doctor or a psychiatrist.

I've been having very intense shifts in mental states, ranging from every few weeks to every few minutes. One state I'm often in is depression (from what I've read about it) where I would have incredibly low energy and self-esteem, I wouldn't find any joy in anything I usually love, and I feel really detached from everything. I feel like an observer to everything including myself. Although occasionally I would feel like myself, in fact maybe even too much like myself. Then I would randomly and without explanation go numb, stop feeling emotion, and detach from everything again. 

When I'm in a depressive state I'm often very irritable and prone to wanting to interact with the people I'm closest to constantly despite them not wanting to. I would overthink constantly and I would just hate myself more and more until I shifted states. I would resort to suicidal thoughts to calm myself down whenever something would happen (which is admittedly sort of ironic, but it works for me for some reason).

When I'm in the more emotionless state I would act more normally, I wouldn't be as clingy nor would I overthink or even think negatively about myself. Granted, I would perceive myself as an average human with nothing *too* special about him/myself. During this state I would have a lot more energy, in fact so much that I would constantly be fidgeting and I would have a lot of muscle spasms in my arms and neck.

Everything I just explained has been what's happening regularly for around a year, but for the past 2-3 weeks I've been shifting states very regularly (every few days at max, and even every 10 or 20 minutes. This isn't including normal mood swings that I have depending on the situation) and I've had no appetite for anything. I've lost weight and I've become more pale and dead-looking, plus the dark circles under my eyes have intensified. I've recently noticed myself wanting to sleep more since I can't bear being awake and feeling so horrible, so I would go to bed 3-4 hours earlier than I usually do. (AKA going to sleep at around 11 PM when I'd usually go to bed at roughly 2, 3, or even 4 AM.) I've been forcing myself to eat so I don't become too malnourished. This has all been accompanied by myself changing personalities without knowing it. Close friends of mine have stated that I act like different people depending on the day.

Any thoughts on what might be going on or what I might have?
I've heard people say that I have bipolar disorder, depersonalization-derealization disorder, major depression, borderline-personality disorder, and dissociative identity disorder.

It started very early on in childhood. It wasn't until I was a teenager that I started experiencing panic attacks. Now, I'm a 27-year-old female working on a PhD and teaching at a local University. But my anxiety and panic attacks have gotten worse. 

So I had a panic attack tonight. It came on randomly and lasted quite awhile. I kept thinking about how, at 27, I don't own a home. How I feel like I'm sometimes immature for my age. Sometimes I'm moody. Today I worked all day on lectures and notes and didn't have much time to play with my parrot, I'm a terrible parrot owner. I could also be working right now but instead I'm wasting time on buzzfeed and reddit. I'm stupid and I'm just fooling everyone into thinking I'm smart. People must hate me deep down inside but they just don't show it. There's something fundamentally wrong with me. 

Anyway, those were the thoughts I was having and now the panic attack is pretty much gone. However, I'm wondering now whether those feelings were just a symptom of the panic attack or if they are actually truths I was realizing about myself. In turn, this thought it giving me anxiety. Vicious circle. 

Has anyone experienced this before? :( ",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,Does anyone ever feel like a terrible and awful person during panic attacks?
