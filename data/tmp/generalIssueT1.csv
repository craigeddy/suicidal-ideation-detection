I've been losing my temper over little things and often find myself having quite dark thoughts. I will imagine the person (real or not) often being tortured, mutilated, humliated, etc. That I am in control of the situation and I want to hurt them, repeatedly. Various methods are imagined in this process and I even come up with my own at times. (Imagining myself killing their entire family in front of them). Now I know 100% that I would never attempt to do anything of the sorts. I could never bring myself to do it nor live with myself after the fact. But is it bad of me to indulge in these thoughts and even... take satisfaction at the idea of someone who's wronged me to pay dearly?

I have a craving fueled diet, consisting of diet soda and just whatever I want to eat. There is no regulation. I was exercising regularly but that went down the toilet, although I guess I am not as inactive as I could be. 

I spend hours and hours a day on the computer and playing video games. My sleep schedule is bonkers, some days I will sleep 12 hours and some 4. Sometimes I will be up all night and then all day and sometimes I go to bed at a regular time (12am or something to that effect). 

I have noticed I am really anxious and kinda depressed lately, I am pretty sure its because of all this. I really should kick myself and get more disciplined and into a routine. I am 6ft and about 160 pounds, I just dont really gain weight. I have noticed that a lot of people live like this, glued to a computer for most of their off time and just in a lifestyle of eating shitty and sleeping shitty. I ask myself if this trend is why people are generally anxious and depressed, most of the people I interact with say they struggle with at least some form of anxiety and/or depression.


People are spending more and more time indoors glued to monitors, eating sugar and fat laden diets. Are we as a society just prone to this because of the lifestyle our habits have cultivated over the past 30-50 years or so? I read a study that said by 2050 the majority of people will be myopic (nearsighted) because of how long we spend on electronic devices. 

I mean we have a culture of crash and burn, consume caffeine like a mad dog, work your ass off every breath, 5 hours a night is fine, take a xanax for your anxiety. Ugh, it is all too much. I mean I guess my question is, excluding genetic mental disorders, are we all just melting our brains with our crappy ass lifestyles? Is the uptick in depression and anxiety to do with how we live?

For the past few years something changed in my head. I went from an arrogant, over confident person to the most quiet and alienated person I ever saw. 
I can´t talk to anyone. I CAN NOT approach someone first. When someone talks to me I answer, but I can see that my answers just kind of push people away. I tend to agree with everything and add nothing new to the little conversation that is every conversation i have. 
I came to enjoy the loneliness but loneliness is not the reason that brought me here.
Some might say these are depression/anxiety symptoms, but the truth is that this I explained above is the only problem I have that fit the usuall symptoms(and lost of interest in some before loved activities maybe). I don´t have any problem with being in a crowded place, make presentations in front of several students (as long as I have the presentation memorized), never had any suicidal thought or any physical pain without a reason. 
Could this be something else not mental related?! Please give me your opinion. Maybe here I´ll find a way to make this make sense.

I'm no writer of any sort (obviously) so apologies if the grammar is not 100%. With that out the way, I started this just for myself with no intention other than to be a coping mechanism. However, further down the line I started to realise that this could potentially help other people who go through the same difficulties on a daily basis and most importantly, could raise a huge awareness upon mental illness. Evidently, mental illnesses are not often talked about, but often brushed under the carpet and almost frowned upon. Because of this, this creates a humongous amount of stigma attached to this topic which can result in a person feeling even more embarrassed or ashamed; which of course they should never be made to feel. I hope this gives you an insight into what it's like living with a mental illness on a daily basis, hope you enjoy the read!

“It's exhausting having to fight a war inside of your head.”
Imagine this. Your heart is racing at what feels like two thousand beats per minute. Both fists clenched into a tight, tight ball. Sweating, from every existing gland in your body. Palms so wet whilst instantaneously losing grip of everything you touch. Confusion, nothing makes sense as thoughts are rushing around in your head from every direction, disturbing your vision as you do everything in your power to see straight. A tight ball like feeling in your throat, so tight that you cannot breath. It’s the feeling you experience when the edge of a crisp gets stuck in your throat, slowly and painfully cutting your glands. A sick like feeling, wanting to let it go but doing what you can to keep it back. Don’t embarrass yourself like this, not if people are watching. Now onto the chest. Feeling so tight and heavy as if someone is standing on top of you, crushing you with every power and strength within them, whilst you pant and gasp for air and catch each and every breath that your body allows you to. Shaking, crying, sweating, tensing, shivering, trembling. And now slowly breathe with every bit of energy that is left in you. You are fine, you are alive and it’s over for now. 

The brain is a complex thing, just as complex as ones human mentality. The limbic system controls emotions within the human brain, there's no surprise that at the best of times you feel as if you have a complete lack of control over your emotional and mental state. The brain is so incredibly complex that it often even puzzles scientists; the same people who allowed the first human beings into space and onto the moon. The same people who are able to clone living and breathing animals, create satellites for outer space, discover electricity, gravity, evolution, DNA. And yet, they fail to completely understand the human brain and each function that is involved and why they are involved. Many people fail to realise that not everyone thinks in the same way, not one person has the same thought process as another human being walking this earth. What may seem logical and rational to one human being may seem completely and utterly bizarre to another. 

There is a fine line between feeling lonely and being alone. In the depths of the night when the sun has set and there is nothing to see in the deep sky apart from the twinkling of the bright stars. Hearing the occasional sound of a car passing by, the tree leaves lightly tap-taping against the window due to the slight breeze in the dead of night. The sirens that wake the streets; whilst people question if a life has just been taken from us, or is it that a life is about to enter our world of mystery? At night, when people lay asleep with their heads softly against their pillow, you lay there gazing at the ceiling, unable to sleep, wondering to yourself what you could have done differently that day. Sleep. 7 to 8 hours of sleep they say. But what if you can't sleep due to the constant thoughts and feelings rushing through your head from that day, from weeks, months, even years ago. The mind is a dangerous place, a place that I fear as I know it is stronger and more powerful than I am. Have you ever been surrounded my so many people, so many bodies, but felt so lost. Helpless. Alone. Questioning how the silence can be so loud. Lost in thought, whilst hearing the mummers of those surrounding you. 

Imagine feeling a prisoner of your own body. The only body you will have for as long as you may live. The body that will grow and cherish into something beautiful at adolescence. The body that will make love to another body, feeling each and every edge and crevice. The body that will see into the eyes of their loved one, touch their hand, smell their recognisable scent, one that comforts them with ease. The body that will taste their sweet lips and the body that will hear their touching and soothing voice gently in their ear. The human body is a remarkable thing, each and every one unique and different in every way, shape and form. But what happens when you start to lose control of your body, the one body that is yours and no one else's. When your bones feel weak and your limbs like jelly. Like you're floating on a cloud, uncertain about those sweet lips you once kissed, those gentle voices you once heard, the feel and warmth of the person you love turn to cold, the smell no longer there and their eyes unfamiliar with fear. You start to lose everything you once remembered, everything you once cared for and everything that your body allowed you to do. Eventually, they all just become distant memories. All the people you have met become lost faces. 

Time. Time is inevitable. Too little time, or too much time? Should you be too early, or just on time? Time is a concept made up by human beings. The sun rising suggests it is morning time, the sun setting however, you guessed, implies that the day is coming to a close and all is left is the dark night's sky. What if there were no such thing as time? Would people be less stressed, less rushed, less busy? What would people do to insure they are being kept occupied? How would the world go on? When you become lonely, sad, anxious, depressed; time works in two of which ways. Time either stands still or in contrast, goes as fast as lightning and by the time you know it, you lose track of where you are, what you have done, even who you are. On average, it takes a human being 2o muscles to smile and 50 muscles to frown. Yet, why are there so many people spending their days crying, worrying, distressed surrounding themselves in pity and self doubt. If it takes such little muscles to create a smile, how does it become so hard for someone to put one together. Their smile may be imperfect, broken or even jiggered, but it is still a smile that may bring delight into someone's bleak day. A smile has the power to touch someone's heart, touch someone's soul. Imagine, for whatever reason you felt as if you could no longer smile without it feeling fake, like a scam. Seeing another smile, a smile of a friend, a loved one, even a stranger; can bring you so much joy and happiness to someone.

Breathing. An essential, necessary part of life. Any life. We all breath, if it wasn't for our power to breath none of us would be here, would exist, the world would be an empty, lonely shell. But what if with every breath you take, your lungs feel like they are filled with water. Like someone is crushing your windpipe, struggling to breath without the aid of another existence. Each breath getting slower, harder, faster, slower, faster, harder. Until you can no longer take it anymore. Until you collapse in a ball, questioning the why's and the what's and the who's. Whoever put me on this earth, whatever is out there, why me? To breath like another human being, that's all that I ask of you. 

Excuses, excuses, excuses. I can't say I'm anxious, I already said that last week, and the week before, and probably the week before that too. I'll say that I'm ill, yes, just ill. No questions asked, just ill. That way, I won't look lazy to them. I won't have to explain myself, why I'm feeling this way. The reality is, I don't even know myself. How do you explain that to someone when you can't get the right words out? When nothing you say will make sense, when you don't know why you're up and you're down, all day every day. How do you explain that to someone on the outside? That it's a constant cycle of emotions. That, however much you try you cannot leave your bed. That each step you take that day, all you are looking forward to is returning to your room, surrounded by darkness and crawling back into bed. Sleeping. Your safe place, where no one can disturb you, not even the cars outside, the voices echoing the streets, the sound of the metro line, Because you are alone with your thoughts in the darkness, until you slowly drift off into a long sleep. Too little sleep or not enough, there is no in between and no matter what, tiredness always wins. It defeats you, laughs at you and mocks you. Tiredness is a silent killer. It waits until you are energised, finally feeling happy until it creeps out on you from nowhere, like burred treasure among the sands over the blue, clear waters. 

Panic. What do I do with my day? Slowly awaken, shower to wake up the mind, the body the soul. Get ready and feeling good, quick look in the mirror, today could be a good day. Ready. Panic. What do I do now? When was the last time I ate? Am I eating because I'm hungry, or because I know it's the right thing to do? Because my body needs the nutrients in order to survive. Baby steps. No more routines, I'm free to the world but the freedom is almost suffocating. Procrastinate. Endless hours upon hours doing nothing but everything, trying to eat, trying to breath, trying to be normal. The skies are getting dark and the streets are becoming quieter. Time to sleep, my favourite part. Dreams, dreams about love, romance, the best days of your life so far. Woken up suddenly with what feels like a tonne of bricks hitting against your forehead. Awaken, get ready, repeat. 

Coldness. It creeps up on you, sending tingles and shivers all throughout your body. From your neck down to the depths of your spine, through your legs, your arms, to the tips of your fingers and your toes until you slowly start to feel like a stray dog, left all alone on a cold winter’s night. No owner, no food, no home, nothing. You are left feeling like nothing, invisible. Invisible to yourself, your neighbours, your friends. Would anyone notice if I were to go? Leave this place, this town, this city, this world and never look back? Who would miss me? No. That isn't me talking, I am fine. I am no longer in control of my emotions; I have been taken over by a rush of coldness and hotness all at one. Confusion. Why is it so hard to think straight, to see straight, to be normal. What is normal, if there is such thing?

“Patience is a virtue”, one of my favourite sayings. To have patience with someone shows that you care. You are passionate about what they have to say. Their thoughts, feelings, emotions, ideas, philosophies. It puts things into perspective, indulges you with new knowledge and education. Feeds your brain in more ways than you realise. You almost start to care more about their ideas than your own, as you analyse in explicit detail their body language, every hand gesture, movement. You start to become at one with them. But what if, however, you have an astounding amount of patience with these people, but not with yourself. Not with your emotions, your feelings, your thoughts, even your movements. You brush them under the carpet, pretend they're not there. I mean, they're not visible to the naked eye, so no one would notice otherwise. Right? Wrong. Emotions matter, feelings matter. However big, small, funny, comical. We are human beings and as human beings, we must come together. But what do you do when you no longer recognise yourself? The person standing in front of the mirror, that isn't the same person from a few weeks, months, years ago. That smile. That smile that once lit the room has been replaced with something bleak. I wouldn't call it a smile, just a crook of the face. Those eyes. Those eyes that were once filled with joy, now filled with emptiness and water from the never ending tears that are wept throughout the night. Those hands. Those hands that would be used to ride a bike for the first time, draw, paint, now tremble at the whirlwind of thoughts, sweat among the constant pit of sorrow and anxiety and continue to tremble. What happened to her? The twinkle in her eye has disappeared. She looks sad, bewildered, as she looks out into the huge, never-ending world before her.

I couldn't face people today, what if I mess up? What if I embarrass myself? But why should I care, they are strangers who I will most likely never see again. Oh, but what if I do? Would they remember, would they care? Thoughts spinning round in my head. It's wanting to go out, but not wanting to socialise. Wanting to be successful, but being afraid of failure. Wanting long lasting relationships, but not wanting to show people your real self, your self-pity, self-loathing, sad self. It's wanting to eat, but not physically being able to. It's waning to go for a walk, a run, but not having the energy to. It's wanting to go to a party, wanting to get dressed up, but not wanting to make small talk with people, strangers. It's wanting to be productive, but not wanting to get up on a morning. It's wanting to sleep, wanting to shut down, but finding every distraction you can to stop yourself. It's wanting to be happy, but spoiling it for yourself, knowing it won't last for long as the next thing is always around the corner. The next headache, the next bad news, the next anything. It's wanting to be surrounded by people, familiar, comforting faces and places, but wanting nothing but to isolate yourself from the world, alone in your room. It's wanting to travel somewhere new, but not wanting to risk it in case you feel trapped with nowhere to run, no way to get home, no way to get back to your safe haven. It's finding excuses not to do things, not to go places, not to travel, see the world surrounding us. It's finding it easier talking online, through text, as it is in real life. It's feeling not lonely, but alone, with no way to escape the epitome of darkness.

It’s an indescribable feeling. A feeling that doesn’t quite go, doesn’t leave your body and is somehow, always there. A feeling I wouldn’t wish upon anyone, not even the most extreme prisoners. I bet they feel alone, too. Not just a prisoner literally, but mentally. Wishing they could turn back time and be surrounded by friends, family and those closest to them. Instead, they are surrounded by the heavy metal bars that keep them away from society, isolated with only their thoughts. Being a prisoner of your own mind is a dangerous thing. It’s always far easier to just tell people “I’m tired” when they ask how you are, how you are feeling. Because it’s the truth. Physically, mentally and emotionally exhausted. It drains the life from your bones, the happiness from your blood and the soul from your veins. You no longer feel human, like a living and breathing being. You just exist, you are just there. 

Wouldn't it be nice to be young again. To be care free, innocent, knowing nothing but happiness and peace in the world. Cherishing every joyous memory with friends, staying up late watching cartoons. Having no worries, no cares in the world. The only problems we faced were those of the anticipating moments, wondering if we would get our first detention for handing in late homework, or forgetting to underline the date and the title. Oh how clumsy of us! Going home from school wondering if today was the day that the boy from school finally noticed you. Unaware of the evil out there. The violence, the war. The people that were once here, once had families, but lost their battle and couldn't find the light at the end of the darkness. The racism, the religious slurs that leave the mouths of the uneducated, the ignorant. These same mouths that start their day sipping on Chinese tea, getting ready as they put on their Indian shirt and Thai, suede shoes. Wrapping their Swiss watch around their wrist, as time for him is money. Leaving the day behind drinking their Russian vodka, French wine, German beer. Oh the irony. I didn't know about mental illness until twelve years old. Experienced my first panic attack at fourteen years old. Understandably, assuming I was having a fit, heaving a heart attack, dying. What was happening to my body? To my emotions? So powerful and overwhelming that I could not simply control them on my own. If I had known sooner, had a deeper understanding surrounding mental illness; it could have saved me so many sleepless nights. How is it fair that in school, in life, we are only taught about those serious physical illnesses? Broken limbs and body parts, cancer, diabetes, chronic pain, Sclerosis, lung disease, heart disease; the list goes on. However, the views and attitudes towards mental illnesses and disease are not viewed in the same light. Why? Why are they brushed under the carpet so often when they can have such a huge impact upon a person’s life and state of mind? Their ability to enter the real world, form friendships, relationships. Do the simplest of tasks that one with no mental illness would class as the 'norm'. The stigma upon mental illness as a whole is one of the main reasons hundreds, thousands and millions of people are suffering alone, in silence. If I had a broken leg, a broken arm, people would instantly notice me among the crowd. A person's mental complexity is not always recognisable; it can be in any one of us, any 'normal' looking person. Stand a person with a broken limb next to a person with a mental health disorder. Who will get the most empathy, I wonder. The feeling is almost paralysing. It's like learning to walk again, talk again, breath again, live again. 

I managed to leave the house today. It wasn't for long, but I did it. I managed to eat today, too. It wasn't much, but it filled my stomach and my body later thanked me for it. The feeling is still there, but today as I write this, I feel empowered. I feel positive within myself. Earphones in, ignoring the world. Treasuring every moment I can, as I know it won't last as much as I anticipated. The trembling is back, throughout my whole body. So much so that my whole body is numb, almost as if I have been laid in an ice cold bath for hours, days, weeks. The coldness is almost painful, taking over my body. False persona. We all like to show people how well we are doing. We are all guilty of it without even realising. Sharing our lives with complete strangers across the world, throughout various social networks. It's almost like we seek approval from these strangers, thinking it will someone benefit our character or life after we upload that picture, status, post. When really, we are the same person when we go to sleep that night. We are still the same people. Nothing has changed but our ego. Why do we do this to ourselves? It's like we so desperately crave the attention from strangers when the people who care about us most are surrounded us. But maybe sometimes, that isn't enough. And sometimes, it's almost as if we are all living in a fantasy dream world. 

I can't do this anymore; I'm giving up, losing hope. I thought people called them happy pills for a reason. So, why am I feeling so low? So much lower than before. I can't sleep at night. I'm scared to sleep at night as I'm afraid of what tomorrow will bring. What if I waste another day? Imagine that, being afraid to sleep, afraid to wake up on a morning. I spent today looking at four walls. In the room I am confined in, cry in, sleep in, and dream in. It's my comfort, but it's also my prison- my enemy. I couldn’t eat today, the lump in my throat was too big, it wouldn’t allow me to. I want to eat, but I can’t. I also want to sleep, but I can’t. “You could be worse” they say. “Just smile” “You will be fine”. Since when was my mental state something to be compared to? Those words are degrading, humiliating and ignorant. Because I am still here, because my scars have healed, because there isn't a noose tied around my neck. That's enough evidence for them. I'm still here. Still breathing, living, showing my face; so I must be fine, right? Oh, they couldn't be more wrong. You cannot simply compare mental illness so lightly, as if you are comparing fractions in a maths equation. We are not numbers, we are human beings. Each person fighting their own battle. Why do we also tend to glamorize mental illness? Why is it seen almost like a new trend? Like they somehow make a person cute, but an awkward cute. There is nothing beautiful about a mental illness. They are ugly, they are evil, they are soul destroying. They keep you awake at night and make you question every aspect about yourself; your mind, appearance, your body. They make you question why you are not good enough. Why you are not like the others your age. I would rather have nothing at all and wake up every morning happy and energised, than carry the weight of a mental illness on my shoulders, weighing me down in all that I do. However, I am not and will not be defined by my mental illness, it is a part of me, my life. Where I go, it will follow, but I refuse to allow it to steal my identity. 

It makes you fear the world. Fear the future. Even fear yourself; your mind, thoughts, feelings. You isolate yourself from the world, your friends and the people closest to you who you care for the most. It makes you silent. It takes your voice, your passion. Until you are sat there, weak and lifeless. I wonder what it's like. To wake up on a morning, take a shower, put on your clothes and get ready for the day without a thousand and one thoughts whirling around in your head like a never-ending cycle. I wonder what it feels like to wake up on a morning without a headache, without the urge of wanting to vomit. I wonder what it's like to live an ordinary life. One where you don't over think every minuscule detail. One where you are able to leave you house without panic or fear. One where you are able to walk down the street not being paranoid that everyone is staring at you. Do I have toothpaste around my mouth? Food on my chin? I wonder what it's like to be sat in a crowded room, a loud crowded bus without feeling suffocated. Without wanting to leave as quickly and as desecrate as possible. I wonder what it's like to not have to lie. When someone asks how you are doing to not respond with “I'm just tired”, but to tell them exactly how you are feeling. I wonder what it's like to not wake up with eyelids so tired that they struggle to stay open, struggle to stay awake. I wonder what it's like to go about your day, questioning ho much sleep you think you'll be able to have tonight. Will it be 4 hours? 5 hours? Maybe 6 if we're lucky. I wonder what it's like to be optimistic about the future and not dwell on the past. I wonder what it feels like to say you're happy without having to fake a smile. I wonder what it's like to be in love with your body, every curve and edge. I wonder what it's like not crying in the shower, most if not every day. I've forgotten the last time I didn't feel constantly drained, exhausted. To not wake up every day with the same headache, feeling the same as I did the night before. I've forgotten what it feels like to get dressed on a morning, eat breakfast, without it feeling like an accomplishment. 

I visited my old school the other week. It brought back so many memories. The place I was taught about new ways of thinking, new ideologies. The place I grew, developed and matured. The place I learnt a lot, not just in Maths, Science and English, but about myself. The place I created and developed new, exciting friendships. Friendships that still continue to grow six years later. It's an odd place is school. It's a place where you experience the best time of your life, but to contrast that, the most challenging and difficult times you will face. Isn't it funny how each person is categorised into groups, into status, into 'coolness'. But, in five, ten, twenty years time, the status you once had, the popularity you once gained will no longer mean anything. In the real world, people don't like you for the popular image that you depict of yourself. They like you for being a humble, genuine and kind person. Well, that's how it should be anyway. School can be a challenging time for those who feel alone, feel as if they don't fit in, like the black sheep among the crowd. I remember my first day of my new high school like it was only last week. Year nine, thirteen years old, the age that everyone has already made their friends, already known each other, already knowing the school like the back of their hand. I had never felt so lost. Leaving my friends and family behind. My lovely, beautiful Grandma. Who the next time I would see, would sadly no longer be here. having to start a new life up here, with unfamiliar faces, unfamiliar voices. I hated being the new girl, I never did like drawing attention to myself. What if nobody would like me? What if people were to laugh at my accent and not be able to understand me? A hundred and one thoughts whirled around in my head that morning, as I put on my new white crisp shirt and fastened my long, navy tie. 

I was lucky. I was treated with kindness, respect and loyalty from these people, these people that had never met me before. For once in my life, I felt apart of something, apart of a bubbly and comical friendship group; I knew it was something I would latch onto. They made my days better, more entertaining. Cheering me up when I would get bursts of anxiety, missing my one best friend back at home who was nearly three hours away; ninety two miles to be exact. One phone call away, that's all it would take. But it would never compare to the comfort of her voice, her being, her warmth. Nine years of friendship to be turned into conversations on Facebook, on text, with just the blur of her photo to be seen. Nothing can compare to the love you have for your closest, dearest friends. Those friends that would do anything to see you happy, see you smile, walk the ends of the earth for you. Keep them close, as their love is eternal and I personally, am eternally grateful. 

School was going well, my work and understanding of each subject was also going well. But for some reason, there was an unfamiliar cloud of darkness hovering over me, overwhelming me with a mix of emotions that I didn't quite understand. Tears pouring down face at unexpected times, unsure why Embarrassment, as people would show their concern, asking what the matter what, but I simply couldn't reply as I didn't know myself what was wrong. I had nice friends, a support network, great family, a new bigger house with my own huge bedroom, everything I could need. So what was the matter? Why would I come home from school with tears filling my eyes, so sad and confused? What else would I need? What could I do possibly to fill this emptiness in my head, in my stomach, in my life. I was thirteen years old, I knew I shouldn't be feeling like this. I should be out making memories with my friends, not feeing alone, feeling this way. Time passed and my confidence grew. Although I knew at the back of mind something wasn't quite right, I still pushed myself and acted as if things were normal. I didn't want people to see me like this, see me so weak, like a burden to people. I just wanted to be a normal teenage girl, who would go to sleepovers with- friends, eat too much ice-cream at midnight until she felt sick and giggle herself into a deep sleep. I was a joker. Would make people laugh until they could hardly breath. I liked seeing people smile because of me. Laugh at me. Not at me, but with me. I enjoyed bringing happiness into other people's lives, as it made up for the happiness that was absent in my own. While all of my friends would spend their weekends being sociable, visiting cinemas, parks, town, I would spend most of mine alone, in my room. Watching videos, drawing, eating, to pass time. I remember feeling a bitter jealousy inside of my stomach. Jealous of those friends who could go out, into large crowded areas and enjoy themselves without the heart palpitations, the sweated palms or the sick like feeling in the pit of their stomach.",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,"""The Unspoken Truth""- A short story about my personal experiences with anxiety and depression"

She lives by herself and works a full time job with shitty hours and shitty management, but also spends a lot on her cats or cigarettes. She is into spirituality and healing with rocks (Whatever makes her happy), but also refuses basic medicine when she's sick, and outright rejects the notion of ever going through chemo or radiation therapy if she got cancer, saying that her spirituality group could help her better. That scares the shit out of me.
And now backstory: When I got out of high-school, my best friend died in a car crash a couple days after I graduated. This devastated me (who already attempted suicide twice), and everyone that knew him, especially his ex.


Who I am now in a relationship with 4 years later. ^^^*cough*


I ended up in the hospital in October for 2 weeks for a psychiatric evaluation, and ended up being diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder with severe suicidal depression. 2 days into being in the hospital, my girlfriend was acting distant, and I asked her what was going on. She said she felt a dis-connect between us, and I asked if she wanted to be in the relationship anymore, to which the answer was a simple ""No"". I said goodbye, and didn't talk to her for a month.


After that month however, she said she wanted to talk to me and come over to her place and explain a few things. So I go over, and after about 4 hours of talking, we're back together.
It is now February, and a week ago I called her and told her I needed a few weeks space to figure out how to look after myself and not feel the pressure of a relationship that was already on uneven ground. I've come to the conclusion that, yes, while I love her dearly, I am not in the right space or mindset to be in a relationship, because if I can't even look after myself without worrying about killing myself, I can't possibly try to make someone I love happy on top of that every week.


So right now her and I have had no contact for a week, I'm thinking I need to break off the relationship to save myself from stress that could be a danger to me, but I'm also feeling like that would be a huge mistake and that I need to make sure she's happy. I'm all up in knots, scared shitless to say anything to her and I'm scared shitless I'm going to do something really stupid after I talk to her. I love her so much, but I just can't meet the expectations and function at the same time.


**tl;dr**: In a relationship, I'm mentally ill, she's stressed, she's my dead best friend's ex, can't handle it anymore, but feel the need to make her happy.

Obligatory Dx complications: Really high functioning, just on the threshold, more of a HF PDD-Nos case.... I very empathetic and I understand social interactions... Just I'm not very good with communicating... Too much sensory overload. I'm also an emotionally unstable, yet strangely detached and sarcastic asshole but anyways... Oh and sadist, but the consensual kind so not to worry. Oh and I love chaos, adrenaline and manipulation, so maybe I am just a sociopath or more accurately I have a few more traits than most people.

Let me illustrate what I am talking about by talking about the relationship with a friend of mine, She was my only friend, friend who did care about me, I met her at 12/13, and I'm now 18, she's 19... We were in the same school year group, so we spent a lot of time together. Little did she know how much I liked her until around 14, friendzoned so bad aha. Then around 16 we both had this intense intimate friendship with way too much confusion, and sexual tension... So it was weird and complicated

I don't know why I liked her so much, she wasn't like very attractive in a socially conventional sense, (to me she was of course)... She was only 5ft and blonde with the bluest eyes and... Biggest nose haha... Well big like hawkish (loved it) the tiniest smile, quite not chubby but not average... Clumsy, neurotic, hand flapping awkward mess(I hope you don't read this!) Her smell though, love her pheromones, made my blood boil.... As she has got older now she is very attractive.

She was plain confused by me, because the more I become emotional involed, the less I can communicate, the more I like someone the less I can show them, so it comes out as angry and hurtful, toxic sexually charged conversations, and like what appeared to be false sincerity. It also didn't help that she also had severe mood problems, suicidal ideation, and just like 20  boyfriends *with the criteria of are they stupid and abusive, will I get hurt, so I can build upon my guilt complex and irrational self-loathing?* I often wonder what her childhood was like, her eyes in a childhood photo they were as sad as mine. We shared a past of being bullied outcasts, Haha. She said mine was extreme, very extreme (it was and I spent my childhood years in agony and isolated due to psychosomatic pain disorder on top of being beaten all day and emotionally shredded), but there is something she wouldn't tell me... 

I tried my best to protect her, from shitty boyfriend, to comforting and supporting her after she was raped... I tried so hard, I feel like I failed her because sometimes we fell out and we falled out hard, she however said I really helped. Eventually before we broke contact around (17/18) we fell out every two weeks almost, often her being tearfully angry, I knew what I was doing, just I don't know why I was so horrible. She knew I was a sadist, and I must have been confusing for her, as my mental health tanked, which when she left I had a breakdown, due to secondary trauma, my untreated trauma, depression... Guilt. Started hearing things and stabbing myself/not sleeping. She cared for me a lot and always forgave me... So patient and you know when someone remembers stuff you say? That's so nice, then uses it to be supportive, totally new to being on the receiving end of that!

Later in therapy I started talking about her and I never cried... I spoke about myself very eloquently using my psychology knowledge to be very introspective (without really saying anything haha!). I have some fairly present dissociative symptoms... So I am detached, I sound just as flat, I'm completely well... dead, fish eyes... I look normal but... I feel so far gone. 

Except when I talked about her the psychologist noted how animated I became, and smiling and my voice prosody became normal... Like someone switched me on again. Before hand I figured I was just morbidly infatuated... Except then I realised I love her... I mean, I'm more self-loathing than her so I would rather believe morbid infatuation over all the evidence of my actions and her actions haha. I obviously nearly cried, and stared at the wall. 

(At this point the psychologist was like he's way too complex for standard CBT, abort, abort. Especially as they then refered me on, perhaps because to them that was the only real evidence of non-faked emotional response, then they realised I duped them.)

So naturally I figured I'm only alive when I am with her, don't get me wrong I am perfectly functional, in a nihilistic, permanently avoidant and dark humoured kind of way, I volunteer a lot and help people (totally over compensating!). I could go around the world not giving a shit, on a personal level, I have no self-preservation, x-altruism all that malarkey. Other than human rights and feminism (which is human rights btw) I fight to my dying breath for that. I f'king hate moral hypocrisy. Plus people who are stupid enough not to be nihilists and to tell people what to do as if they have authority to do so in this meaningless universe (which is why I don't kill myself it is as pointless as living)

With her though I redeem myself... Sure she manipulates sometimes, and so do I but we stick out for each other.. we've hurt each other, but the good stuff meant a lot to both of us, She loved/hated how empathetic I am, I could just read her, she expected me to hate what I saw, I didn't. I don't hate anything.

So I decided to contact her again, it was going really well, I was older, so was she. I could just about communicate well enough to clear up the fact that instead of saying I hate her I meant I love her... I can never explain anything to anyone, even here. She even liked the idea of being tied up, and some even more edgy BDSM stuff, so yay wouldn't have to suppress the urge to choke her anymore! Anyways our paths had diverged, middle class me off to university, and her just as smart as me (we're pretty smart I was attracted to her cus she was probably as smart as me), but she's stuck at home regretting her descisions paying her parents all her money. 

So we were just pumping all these emotions into an impossible situation... Until boom it all collapses, I unable to express throughout recontacting her that she hurt me, meant that tension overflowed and I reverted back to being a red-flag spewing psycho.. She is far more mature now and refuses to contact me, and I'm old enough not to send loads of PMs until she responds . She always said that she didn't deserve me, (I know cliché not bs though with her self-image) but it was the other way round I don't deserve her...

So I know you could say all the standard get over it crap, but it isn't just about her it is about the fact that my childhood seriously effected me, I know this and no one intervened, but just at the last window of opportunity I became attached to her, and she has had to endure all my warped... Stuff, she should have never approached me. Maybe we are both messed up. The fact of the matter is, this will be with me for the rest of my life, it will effect my descisions, behaviour, thoughts and feelings... And I lost my chance to get it back, so who knows what I will become and do.

It never got me down or flummoxed before but now I really want to lash out at people for stupid things. I recognise that I am good at my job, but I'm very anxious at my desk and I recognise the reasons why I'm anxious but it still does not make the feeling go away. I cant concentrate, my mind races constantly, I'm getting upset rather easy and constantly in a state of worry. I'm wondering am I depressed or stressed. I cant go on like this for much longer without having a complete nervous breakdown.

This is not something that pops into my head as an intrusive thought, nor is it something that develops in anger or rage. These feelings are usually pleasureful and sexual in nature. I find myself enjoying the suffering of almost everyone around me, but particularly when it is physical. I have seen major accidents and witnessed violence in person and felt a sense of excitement and endorphins released from imagining inflicting the pain myself. 

I am not bothered by the fact that I have these thoughts, but it has been frustrating me lately because I have no way to act them out without ruining my life. I have a good marriage and career and generally like my life, so I see it as important not to take any risks that could destroy everything I have worked for. I also understand that I am likely to be harmed or killed in the process and would never get away with it. 

In the last year, I decided to kill a stray cat just to have the experience of killing something. I lured it with drugged food, bound its legs, and stabbed it in the side of the stomach with a kitchen knife. There was definitely some thrill in the action, but overall not as exciting as I hoped considering the mess and clean up. I do think it would be far more exciting with a person as humans are more understanding of their situation and able to react in more interesting ways. Plus, there is simply more challenge in it. 

I always felt that I could stick to just fantasy and keep these thoughts seperate from my daily life, but my obsession with them is starting to become too much and I feel like I may say or do something stupid at some point.

I can handle things, but, I don't know until when. It took me years to finally reach this point, and even now, I'm still not sure if I should still pursue to get help. And since I just arrived in Canada, I have no idea how stuff work, particularly the healthcare system. 

My first question is where to start. My problem is I have no idea what my problem is. The local resources I see thru pamphlets are for addiction and suicide, I think my problem is neither since I never do drugs or take anything excessively, nor do I plan killing myself that much. I don't know who to talk to. I don't even feel comfortable talking to my parents about it, and they're the only people actually talk to. Where should I go? I'm doing this as discreet as possible so I don't make my parents worried of me. But if I can't, well, that's still okay.

My second question is about the cost. Does the initial thing cost something?

My third question is does it always have something to do with therapy with talking stuff. I don't really talk much. (Which could also be one of my problems, though.) One thing stopping from pursuing help is just me avoiding to talk to other people. But Canadians sure do talk, it's scares me. (But I can still somewhat cope)

My fourth question is should I get help. I've been thinking about this for months. I thought of the costs, my parents getting worried, me exaggerating things, the pretentiousness of me being new in Canada… Then I thought of me struggling with school projects that require interaction, interaction with anyone at all, or pursuing myself to get out of bed and do general things everyday. I think I'm just lazy, shy, and I lack self-discipline. Another thing that pushed me to try to get help is my mom always getting worried of me of forgetting things (and she sometimes notices I just idle unusually). She even had nightmares telling me to not forget going home. I think I'm exaggerating, sometimes not. But then again, I'm able to cope with these things all these years. But they say: (if I get help,) everything  is going to be as clear as night and day. It's just a dilemma. Should I get help?

TL;DR:
New to everything in Canada, where to get help in NT, Canada?
How much does those stuff cost?
Do I need to talk in a group?
Should I get help?

Thank you so much if you've read everything, knowing someone out there read this could enough get me through this day. (Yay! I got the the guts to post these things)

I don't know what to do, I fear he will flip out if he knows he has to stay longer and then he really will stay a while and be depressed or something.

I don't have any questions but I just thought it would be helpful to write down what I'm going through in a space where people going through similar situations may see it.

Last year my wife left me because she realized she was a lesbian. This happened only a few months after I started realizing I was transgender. Her leaving me even though I was planning on transitioning still makes sense for a variety of reasons but I find it very confusing and distressing. I was often depressed before she left me, especially for the last year, but I was able to function mostly normally because I leaned heavily on her to give me direction and purpose. I was never a whole person by myself. But now that she's gone, everything is so empty.

I spend the vast majority of my time in bed. I've set some minimum requirements for myself that I've mostly managed to keep to: eat three meals a day, drink water, go to martial arts twice a week, go spend time with friends at least a couple times a week, keep the house mostly clean. I still manage to meet all my expectations at work, but honestly I work from home and nap most of the day. At night I usually stay up until somewhere between 2am and 5am watching Netflix. The rest of the day I lay in bed doing nothing on my phone for hours, desperately thinking about how I need to get out of bed and do something specific but never being able to find the will to do it. My brain feels numb and unfocused all the time. Disassociating has always been my chief coping mechanism but it's never felt as tangible as it does now. I'm constantly sleepy. I've committed to trying to get at least a straight 7 hours of sleep every night but my success has been mixed. 

I started seeing a therapist and he put me on Lexapro and Wellbutrin. The drugs helped me stop having suicidal ideation (which I've had most of my life), helped me stop getting trapped in cycles of negative thoughts, and helped me regain a little bit of a feeling of purpose at my job. But the therapist is honestly a mess. He refuses to believe anything other than the fact that everything I'm going through is a grief response to the divorce. Maybe because I never really sought therapy before. I told him I'm worried about ADHD, OCD, Bipolar or Depressive, Autism Spectrum, which he pretty much ignored. Every time I go see him it's always ""how do you feel about your parents"" or ""I think last time we discussed that you were having trouble sleeping, how's that going?"" When I see him I can never find the words to express what's wrong, probably because making myself vulnerable like that triggers a big dose of disassociation. He's useless. I haven't told him about my gender identity issues because I don't really feel any trust towards him and it's a very vulnerable thing to talk about. I'm on a waiting list for a therapist who specializes in gender identity and seems like she will be a better fit, but it's been two months on that waiting list. All the therapists under my insurance that aren't shit are impossible to get appointments with.

I miss my ex-wife. We talked about needing space and only spending time together in groups for a while, even though we want to stay friends. Still, even under those constraints I really feel her pulling away from me. She's implied to me that she's having a harder time getting over me than she expected and she needs to be more distant than she expected because of that. I understand, but I miss my best friend so much. And I'm still not a whole person, but without someone to dump all my issues on I'm just a mess.

Edit: I should also add that the only time I feel completely present is when I'm working on my transition. Doing research, shopping online for girl clothes, working on growing my hair out, learning make-up. I guess it's pretty much what I currently live for.",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,My current situation

My brother and I are 3 years apart (him older, me younger) and we had a sort of close relationship- or so my parents could call it that. 
Being the youngest, of course I endured the normal experience of sibling rivalries and constant bickering towards each other. It's normal and I guess somewhat healthy. 
And I had days where we could be civil and play together and actually agree on what movie to watch with dinner. 
But things changed as we grew up. 
I was 10 and he was 13. I was still little enough to be playing with barbies and have a flat chest, but he was struggling with a new environment (highscool), friendships, and that magical package deal of teen hood; puberty and hormones.
Unfortunately, despite my young age, I was physically developing; my hips grew wider, my butt got bigger, and my chest began to bud. 
He noticed. In fact, he was the one that pointed it out before I did. I didn't know what was happening to me, nor did it really bother me. But for some reason, it affected him? I don't know. But suddenly, after a while, he began to do a little more than just hug me, and he hugged me a lot as far as older brothers go. He would sniff me and say I smelt beautiful, and would sort of gush over my 'curves'. I did not feel comfortable and something told me that this was not right, but I didn't understand. And I thought; 'okay, he's older, he knows what's what,' and I trusted him. So I ignored the strings of my doubt and went along with it. He called it Special Hug.

More and more happened each time. And it was like I had no privacy anymore. He wouldn't knock; he didn't see a problem with waking in on me changing or taking a shower. And when we were infants, it wasn't a problem, so I thought it was okay. 
This went on for almost a year, and it didn't stop until the end of 2008. 

During the time, I started to speak my thoughts and I asked him about it a couple times. He would respond with; 'it's okay, we're not really doing anything,' or just 'it's okay and I love you,' 

Really bitch?! Really?!?! 

After while, my doubts kept creeping up on me and made me feel very uncomfortable to point where it would upset and frustrate me a great deal. I wasn't into it and surely anyone would half a brain would have seen that, it was almost as if he didn't care about how I felt, he was just concerned about what he wanted. 

Fucking prick.

When I actually built up the courage to tell him that I didn't want to anymore (not that I ever really did) he would put on this really sad face and hang his head slightly and go; 'oh, okay,' and mope, leaving me to feel guilty and absolutely miserable. Why? Because I did love and look up to my brother and I despite this, I didn't want to lose him. So I caved, and this kept happening each time I tried to stop it. 
It tore me up inside. I was so young, too young. 

What horrible thing does a child -boy or girl- do to deserve this? What could I have possibly have done to deserve any of it? This stuff doesn't leave you. It's dangled like a wind chime in your head forever, even if you stuffed that memory right at the back of your mind, you can still hear its whisper. 

My mum caught him once jabbing me way too much and in certain parts of my body that weren't appropriate, and gave him a big lecture about it, which made him burst into tears and said; 'is that what you think I am? A pervert?' 

Honestly, I snicker at that. I really wish that I could just punch him in the face, I really do. 

After that, it didn't continue. Not that it mattered, the mental scars remain as if it never stopped. And I hate it. 

In all honesty, I do not feel that I can give this the full blame to why I am so messed up inside completely. My self esteem was low, I have high anxiety and I don't feel comfortable with romantic relationships. 
I was bullied for two years and had no friends in that same time period (2008 & 2009) and I was going through puberty before anyone in my classes were (just my dumb luck) and I wasn't very fit and I was chubby because of it- I got body shamed a lot (mostly by girls) and was basically teased and tormented because I didn't really fit in socially, and I was constantly excluded and treated like I was nothing more than the dirt on their polished black shoes.
So, yeah, plenty of things do contribute to my messed up mind indeed, but bullying is something that can (have) be moved on from. 
Being molested and taken advantage of is a completely different kettle of fish. Particularly if it is done by someone who is your own blood; someone who is supposed to protect you and love you appropriately. Someone who is supposed to keep you AWAY from that sort of person. 
I just couldn't believe it. I still can't believe it. 

I was only 10/11 years old. My body may have screamed 12 or 13 but I wasn't. I remained that age between the ears, so again I didn't understand the full extent of how bad and wrong this was and given my discomfort, I buried it right at the back of my mind so I couldn't remember it at all. It took me years to do that, years. It didn't take its full toll on me until I was 17.

He came to me about it. I was 17 and he was 20. I was beginning year 12 and my life was better- I had great friends, I loved my school and I was better socially. 
He however was trapped inside a small tight dome of sadness and sorrow. I felt horrible for him, but I there was nothing I could say or do that would make him feel any better. He was victimising himself, and constantly saying that everyone else was a jerk and that he didn't understand why he was constantly rejected by people. He and his girlfriend had been broken up for nearly a year by then, and the amount of 'friends' he had, minimised. 

I wonder fucking why idiot, they were shitty low lives who used you for rides and alcohol. Fucking duh.

He began to date this new friend I recently made, L, and I didn't know her very well, but I knew enough that she was very superficial and boy crazy so I kept her in small doses in order to maintain my sanity. 
But she decided to eye my brother and he was happy to oblige, despite how uncomfortable it made me feel. I didn't say anything because it was their life, not mine. But the thing is, he's very selfish and jerky when he's happy. I feel so evil and guilty being around him now, because either way, I don't like him. He's an arrogant arse when he's happy  and everything's going his way, and he's an emotionally draining douche when he's down in the dumps. And it's always only one or the other with him, he can't do neutral at all and it's fucking annoying. 
Because L wanted me to come to this event with them and I said no ( I was ill and on my period) he pushed me into coming and did the sad face thing when I said no. I eventually caved and came after all, but I regretted it almost instantly. I counted down the minutes to home time BUT NO it was 12 am and L decided that she wanted him to come over because SHE wanted cuddles and a make out session. 
Imagine being in the same bed as your sibling and their lover as they pash and do stuff in front of you. Feeling uncomfortable yet?! 
I was exhausted and ill, but with no concern for me whatsoever, he instantly agreed.

Fucktard.

And we stayed there until 2 am in the morning. 2 am. She lived at the opposite side of town, at least 20-30 minute drive. I was so angry, but I was too tired to protest, nor did I want to ruin it for him. I tried to dose off in the car, but then he decided to get heated up and angry because someone at the event in our social group said by accident that they thought that he was younger than me. It was so out of the blue when he got angry that i got startled and anxious. He yelled and cussed as if I was the one who said it.i said nothing, but that made me feel even more angry and upset. I felt like crap, I looked like crap, and I felt like all this pressure was forced on me, yet he was the one having a god damn temper tantrum in the car at 2 in the morning? What the hell? 

The next day, I kept myself in my room and refused to come out, even if someone were to beg me. He came in looking normal and chirpy and starts talking about our past like it wasn't a big deal, asking me about it- I tried to brush it off because it had been years and I didn't want it to come back to reality, but he kept going on, saying 'harmless' comments; 'oh, it's just, I read about it, and apparently it can really fuck you up in the future,' 

Really? REALLY?! WHAT DO YOU NEED TO READ TO KNOW THAT MOLESTING YOUR LITTLE SISTER IS WRONG?? AND WHAT RIGHT DID YOU HAVE TO TALK TO ME ABOUT THAT IN A CONDESCENDING FASHION AS IF I WAS THE ONLY MESSED UP ONE? WHY DID YOU FUCKING BRINH IT UP YOU THOUGHTLESS PIECE OF SHIT? DIDN'T IT CROSS YOUR NEXT TO NON EXISTENT MIND THAT IT WOULD UPSET ME? 

Before I could respond, his face had gone all red and he burst into tears and started throwing apologies at me. 
I said it was fine, because again, i really didn't want to hear it as I didn't want to remember it. 
But it was too much. 
I was never good at facing my problems, I always saw as past affairs that are no longer relevant, and if I wanted to respond and get upset, I should have acted when it was happening. 
Hearing this, spending years of keeping this at the back of my mind, it somehow affected me greatly. It was brought back from the dead, the flashes started happening, then the nightmares, it was all whirling in my head, along with everything else that I was still dealing with. I got so stressed. School became hard, communicating with people became hard, my anxiety levels rose up. it was eating me up inside, and it put a real strain my relationship with him. It got so bad to a point where I tried to top myself with mixing bleach with energy drink. Thankfully I was messaging someone at the time and they came straight over and dialled 000. I told my parents about my other problems except that one, because in a way, I felt like I would be betraying him if I said anything. He was on edge emotionally, despite everything that was happening for him, and I thought that this would just go away if I told my new psychologist. 
It didn't.
It made it worse.
I never liked counsellors or psychologists because the procedures were always slow and emotionally draining, almost feeling like they were encouraging me to dwell. I was in year 12 and I had other commitments- I did not have time to DWELL. 
This one also suggested that I ignore him completely, as if he wasn't there. I thought that was complete rubbish and I asked for other strategies. She insisted on telling my mum. 
It was horrible. 
This stranger and I were telling my mother that her son molested someone. That someone being his own sister. It would have crushed her. I'm not a complete brat, I do genuinely care about my parents wellbeing. But later on at home, she asked me to be honest and tell her the truth. Tears obviously weren't enough. She mentioned that I had been dishonest before so my credibility was apparently shaky. Yeah, what serious stuff have a lied about, aside from taking the last biscuit from the jar?! That damaged my confidence in her quite a lot, like she was convinced that I was just a trying to ruin my brother's life, like the awful sister I was, even though it was him that ruined mine. 

She told my dad, and told me that she would speak to him at some point, but was 'worried because he's really on edge,' 
But, I was the one who ended up in the emergency room? Mum? Hello?? 

This was the same person who would constantly death glare any boy I brought home/smiled at me. Saying that he would kill anyone who hurts me, that he would keep me safe, when really, I was safer with those boys than I was with him. He's the one that ruined me to the core, yet here he his acting as if every other guy within my distance was a potential predator. The hypocrisy just makes me want to throw him off a damn cliff.

It just gets harder and harder to be around him now. He spent all of last year on the couch with no job and no life, and telling me everyday what's wrong with feminism and how women are always wrong. It's one thing to have a strong opinion, but having to stomach that same rant everyday, particularly when it conflicts with your views is just absolutely unbearable. Given what he has done, I can't help but scream in my head that he has no right to tell me that nor to force it at me as if he was trying to make me think like him. I still can't have one conversation for more than one minute without it turning into a antifeminist rant. Again, I don't really care, I'm just really sick of hearing it. And I told him that, BUT HE JUST KEEPS CONTINUING LIKE THE DISRESPECTFUL CUNT THAT HE IS. 
And I don't want to hear HIS views on rape and violation because HE VIOLATED ME. Why should I have to put up with this bullshit? Why?! 

My parents don't seem to take any notice of this. Im not comfortable with him kissing or hugging me anymore, or just being in his presence in general. He's at university now in another state, but he's visiting now for my dad's birthday, which is fine, but small doses. I don't go out of my way to hug him to talk to him, I'm just neutral and I pull away every time he tries to hug me. His affection towards me is just too strange and uncomfortable and somewhat creepy. He used to go in my room and go through my things and then get pissed off when I'd tell him not to. When I got some new bras, he was looking at them and started to compare my chest to his ex's. Bit pervy? 

He's strange and tense and I just don't like him or respect him anymore. He's too much for me to deal with and my parents refuse to understand it. Mum is fixated on us being a normal close knit family, whereas there's no such thing. 
I feel forced to have a relationship with him, and I don't want to have one, and it upsets me. It's like I'll have to divorce my parents too if I do him. It's not fair. I love my parents so much and I don't want to lose them but it looks like I may have to after I become an independent adult.

I was raised in a family that kind of inadvertently fostered Co-dependant behaviour through our religion and culture. As a result I have a lot of anxiety when it comes to being independent. I also find myself being very pessimistic whenever it comes to something about my future. I am a very goal oriented person within the confines of what I am allowed to do as a adult woman born to my Muslim family, and I have done my best to excel in school, work or whatever I do. My biggest issue is anxiety. Anxiety that gives me so many painful and negative effects throughout my body. I have come to realize that I always default to thinking the worst could happen to me in my situations, and I worry about it all the time. 

I'm in the middle of leaving my family home without their permission and I will most likely lose my family for a very long time. It's normal to have anxiety in this situation, but I'm afraid my anxiety will really hurt my body. I've been anxious for a week straight.

In the past I have been anxious, but those situations always turned out in my favor and I feel like I might be associating anxiety with success in some strange way. 

Can anyone recommend steps towards a healthier mindset so that I can train myself to stop defaulting to anxiety?

This diagnosis has severely been messing with his sense of identity and confirming in his mind that he's just crazy and will always need treatment. For him, this has just solidified his justification for killing himself.

This morning he said he was at peace with himself because he finally figured out how he was was going to do it. (Not posting the method to avoid triggers, but involves ordering medication online.)

He said he will either do it with my support or without and it was a courtesy to tell me.

From the timeline he described it sounds like I have about a month to work with - sometime before his birthday in May.

He said if I tell his therapist, parents, or call 911, he will just disappear and do it without me.

No amount of pleading or how much I need him to be around is convincing. He says he can't love me if he hates himself so much.

Please, what do I do? If I contact anyone, he'll see this as a betrayal and I risk him disappearing.

Full disclosure: I know the things that I do are not okay. I know I should seek professional help (I have and I am). Posting on reddit is a last resort. So please, no judgement.

Today I did some social engineering to try and find more about my boyfriend's ex. Which is wrong. And I did manage to find out things I had been looking for. But I feel gross about it and anxious and awful. 

I've done many things about my obsession with her that make me feel awful:
-stalk her social media
-pretend to be her on social media as a means of discovering more about her
-tried and hack into her social media, etc.

She lives in a different country or I'd probably try and meet her or something. 

Here's the thing. I've always been obsessed with my boyfriend's exes. I know what triggered it. The first boy I was in love with still had feelings for his ex. He took my virginity and then immediately stated ""I wanted to save my virgnity for [ex-girlfriend] because I love her and not you"". Thus I began obsessively trying to be more like his ex, etc.

It consumes my life. I compare pictures of her and I side-by-side to try and determine who's pretty. Also doesn't help that she's an artist and so am I. So art comparison is huge.

More about me:
I'm a fairly successful person for my age. I work at a high-paying job. I have a 3.8 GPA. I have many friends. I just completed my second gallery show and am working on my third. 

I have an appointment to see a psychiatrist for this very issue and see a counselor regularly. I also meditate and try and maintain a spiritual view of the world. I'm healthy, physically and mentally (except for this one issue). I suspect I may have OCD though.

I've asked random people on the internet to compare us phsyically. And I wish I could share this obsession with someone. I'm just dying to hear ""You're prettier, smarter, more successful, nicer, and have better art"". But I know that's not a reasonable thing to ask for or to want. 

I'm looking for solace. Perhaps someone can relate. Or advice (besides from the 'seek professional help' because I have and I am and it's not doing much for me). Thanks.  ",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,I'm obsessed with my boyfriend's ex and it's ruining my life.

First, I often see myself acting, like it's in a movie. Then, other people are like they're acting, too. Everything feels unreal and I cannot believe it's true in any way. Everything looks unreal, too.

Sometimes, I believe I am in reality in some kind of mental institution, living there being crazy, but in my inner world, there's a completely different story going on (e.g. writing on reddit). Then, some thoughts cross my mind again and again, like in a row. And I get the mental picture of myself in something of a rotating yin-yang-symbol with me in both sides, one happy, one sad, always spinning around. I can differentiate this from reality, but it still occupies my mind.

Then, it's hard to listen to other people. My short-time-memory seems to be kind of weird. Sometimes, I feel like having a billion déjà vus, repeating the same scene again and again (for example, my partner and I sit in the kitchen and eat without talking, then I look at him, he does something, I look away, I look at him again, he does something and so on, in kind of an endless loop; at least it feels like that, it usually is differenciated enough for me so I can see it's not really looped in time.)

Also, I cannot get away from questions like ""what am I?"", ""what does it mean to 'feel' something?"", ""what does it mean for me to have a name?"", ""why am I here?"", ..., I see why these questions are neccessary for a philosophically-interested human, but they're too much in my head since I need to find an answer but I know I never will. I feel, in these situations, very disconnected, not only from my body but also from everything else. I feel like a spectator, living inside a bowl filled with TV-screens that show somebody's life, forcing me to see it as he did.

I feel like a spectator most of the time, even with my own thoughts. And then I think about thoughts and thinking about thinking about thoughts and...

Also, I usually become extremly quiet. I can still talk, and I can still answer, but the answers are short (though usually on-the-point) and I cannot hold up a dialogue.

This all is kind of Ok, but the feeling that nothing, including myself, is anyhow real, that's what bugs me. That's what's giving myself the idea that I am, actually, insane and already in an insane asylum.

I often feel like I am the only thing in existence, and everything else, the stuff I see and hear etc., are just made-up things I created from my mind. This thought never leaves me in such situations (which are often, but not 24/7, luckily).

I've read quite a lot about hebephrenic schizophrenia, and a lot of my stuff matches there, but I'm afraid to go to my psychiatrist and tell him my idea, because, if I'm wrong, I may be assigned a hypochonder and may not be taken seriously.

But except for being kind of quiet, ""outsiders"" cannot feel this. I do not *do* crazy stuff, but think about reality as if I were really crazy. This scares me a lot.

So, what might this be? Might it be schizophrenia-caused or related? And what are further resources to check this out?

-------


Some weird memories surfaced the last couple of years. I don't know how to process this information and am a bit confused.

1. As a kid around 7-8 years old, we were visiting some relatives. I loved computers so the son of the household, 5-6 years older than me, would take me to play computer games. I sat on his lap and his fingers would get uncomfortably close to private areas. Fortunately I had the guts to push his hands away before he could completely get into my pants. ( Holy shit this sounds disgusting after typing that out. :( No idea if it happened just once or more. I don't remember much from being a kid. )

2. In my early teens, I got my own room. Sometimes for some reason I had to share the room with my mother. I remember two nights where I woke up discovering my t-shirt was pulled up and exposed one of my breasts. That only happened when I shared rooms with my mother. Coincidence or did something happen in my sleep? She also asked me once in my mid-teens to strip of my clothes so she could look at my naked body, since ""it's been a while sine she last saw me naked"". I just walked away from her in silence.

3. Verbal abuse? Been called ""broken, ""useless"" (mostly by father) and made fun of in front of other relatives (only mother, example; making spelling errors <- much lol, very fun, my daughter is stupid!) I was often given the cold shoulder if I did something they would disapprove of, i.e; sigh when being told to do a chore, which was ""talking back to them and being disrespectful"". My father would talk to me quite sternly and express his disgust of my behavior and not talk to me for the rest of the day/next morning. The worthless/useless/reaction to sighs thingies are still going on. ( in my 30s now :D )

4. I used to have this semi-weird thing going on. I would think of something nice and immediately or somehow at the same time I'd think the complete opposite. Going from ""Yay, butterflies and rainbows"" to ""I hope the butterflies die and burn in hell"". I would be scared to tears by that. Happens rarely now.

After reading over what I've written, I don't really know what to do about it, since I'm an adult now. Some self-analyzing later this is probably some things resulting in why I absolutely hate being touched/looked at. I don't like talking, since it'll only result in making someone angry or upset. Most of times my brain wants me to die since I was a 10 year old or so.

Could those things like that lead to some kind of trauma/memory-loss? I am however constantly stressed and probably depressed in this environment.

I have been thinking about seeing a psychologist, but I am convinced it'll get me nowhere. Someone got any thoughts about that? Why would I need to see one? Maybe I don't need it after all.

Sometimes I get so tired of crying

And constant, everyday lying

The ""okays"" and ""I'm fines"" and ""everything's goods""

Sometimes I just wish I could 

Say without fear what's on my mind

Spill my guts for the very first time

Every thought that runs its way through my head

And all the times I've wished myself dead

Because it's lonely trapped here in my mind

With nothing but pain and no happiness to find

I try so hard but I just can't tell the truth

Because I'm afraid of hurting you

And I'm afraid of what you might say 

And I'm afraid you might lock me away

In a padded cell with no windows or doors

Where all I can do is stare at the floor

And I guess that's where other mediums come in

Drawing and painting and writing away the sin 

That I committed in being born

Into a family whose minds are torn

And I know I'm not the only one

I have family who know of this lack of fun

But even to them I can't open up 

So I just pour my tears into this cup

Of emptiness, of loneliness, of crippling pain

Knowing that I'm slowly going insane.

I have not left the house overnight for nearly 18 months since I have been living alone. When I sometimes work at night, I leave a webcam on to stream from inside the house so I can check on my mobile. It helps that I now drive a Uber, so I can drive past it also from time to time. when I come back to the house from work, if there's anyone walking past, I walk past, then double back, because I don't want anyone to notice I drive for a living and that I live in that house. My car is parked away from the house. If I see something suspicious, I will try and get the car plates. Sometimes I used to record myself locking the doors to reassure myself that I've locked them properly.

I fear the house getting robbed basically. And my pets are inside too. 

This fear has impacted how i live my life. i turned down a very good  seasonal job last summer which required all expenses paid travelling mon-fri. a couple of months of that would have repaid all my debts and put me in a better position to move out. but I had no savings to do anything before taking on the job. so I turned it down. During that time, I stupidly applied to join the military reserves (not full time service), because I was hopeful that I could either move out, or find someone else to move in before having to travel to a training base (there is a long delay with medical / physical / security, if you're not familiar). But when I was cleared, I was still living alone here, and couldn't face travelling. So I quit. I am ashamed. That I even tried in the first place to protect my country, when i couldn't even protect where I lived. My mother, who lives abroad, has asked me to see her for the past 2 years. Said she'll pay for everything. But I have always refused, because I can't face leaving. 

Is this unreasonable?

How did I get like this? Well in the 4 and half years since I've lived here. The house has been robbed twice. once as I was on sleeping pills, the intruder attempted to smash into the bedroom. it has had its downstairs windows smashed by vandals once. my car was vandalised and burgled twice. once, I was also followed and robbed in the street for drugs, in a case of mistaken identity. the house is near one of those 24hr gas stations, which can attract not nice people. 

It was ok initially. But when things happened, I couldn't move because I was on welfare. now i just cant move because I have too much debt. i can't help but think on one hand, my behaviour could seem odd, but on the other, things have definitely happened.",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,"when does fear become a phobia, hence a mental health issue?"

To put it lightly, I am rather unfortunate in my looks. It never used to really bother me until a series of very traumatic experiences made me very insecure about my appearance and more perceptive towards  how people treat me differently because of it. I am seriously considering cosmetic surgery, like a chin implant or a jaw implant. I really feel terrible, looks definitely matter in the society I was born in. My brother is very good looking and I am the exact opposite. Whenever we are together at a family gathering the difference between how he is treated vs me is like night and day. My mother wont admit it but I can clearly see the difference in treatment. I talked to her about my insecurity and how I know she is treating my brother better but she denies it and offers no support. I don't have anyone to talk to about this so I internalize it and I'm sure it isn't healthy for my mental well being so I'm trying to figure out how to resolve my insecurity and move on and be happy.

My colleague TA was in conversation with a nearby table group about the most attractive people at school. An obnoxious guy from said table exclaimed ""you two would make a cute couple"", to which my colleague TA immediately responded ""eww no, that's disgusting"". The whole class heard and was visibly shocked and some guys were snickering. I got pitiful looks from everyone. I remember clearly the strong feeling of wishing I was invisible. I was humiliated, my colleague TA did not apologize but instead was very pissed at the idea that she was associated with me. The obnoxious guy who said it apologized to HER, saying ""I was just kidding, I wouldn't be as low as to couple you with him"". I had to suffer for 45 whole minutes until the bell rang ... it felt like an eternity. Everyone was silent, there were whispers about people who were deliberating on what just transpired along with pitiful glances from everyone including the teacher. I tried so so hard to hold back tears and I had a huge lump in my throat. When that bell rang I went straight for the exit wanting to relive myself from the situation but two girls called me over and said ""where are you going? I want to talk to you about something."" I didn't want to seem to upset so I stayed to see what they had to say.

Feeling super pathetic that I'm reaching out to a community of people I've never met, but hey, desperate times.
I have had ADD, anxiety, and depression throughout my life but it never extremely affected my daily life until I graduated college. Now I was also diagnosed with avoidance coping, which is a tendency to completely avoid any difficult situation. This means I procrastinate e-v-e-r-y-t-h-i-n-g until the last minute and beyond. I have had months long bouts of suicidal thoughts (with no gumption behind them at all), and just sitting on my ass reading or watching TV and way over eating literally all day because moving would create expectations and self-reflection that could bring about extreme anxiety and depression. It's terrible because I know exactly what I should be doing in order to pull out of this, but I can't bring myself to do it. It just freaks me out and I panic and it's easier to push it off. No amount of trying to self-motivate gets me facing my fears. I am desperate for advice and to hear about any success stories from people who have been in similar situations.

I really hope I'm posting in the right place but if there's anywhere else this should be please let me know. 

I'm worried about my partner and with his permission I'm here to ask if anyone has any similar experiences - we are going to visit a doctor but in the mean time I'd just like to see if anyone has similar problems.

He has exams at the moment relating to his job and this seems to have stemmed from studying for the exams. He tells me he tries to study and he can feel himself losing focus and getting ""fuzzy"" eyes (which we got him glasses for, they helped a little). He says he feels like he wants to just ""shut off"" a very short time after studying and when he tries to re-focus he feels this achey pressure in his head and his head feels full of ""noise"" and he just cannot focus unless he gets absolute silence, which in his job is not often possible.
He says it happens at home too and he gets really stressed at myself and our toddler, he says when he gets this stress and anger it happens again and he gets achey pains in his head and it travels down his body to his legs/back. Then the ""noise"" in his head happens and he finds it really difficult to think about anything.

We are both confused, I'm scared he goes to the doctor and they don't take him seriously - something is wrong and I'm so worried about him and what it could be/what it means,

TL;DR - My partner has trouble focusing, gets angry easily and this makes his head/back/legs sore & his head full of noise.",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,Extremely worried about my partner

I'd still consider myself to be those things in alot of ways. But these days I've realized that the way I value life is quite messed up.

Tonight a friend of mine had a suicidal episode. She has been there for me when I've been through the same, and she's helped me through so much. She visited me when I was in hospital after my attempt. But tonight a part of me wanted her to go through with it so she wouldn't be a bother to me anymore. This is extremely out of character for me. Up until recently, I valued life very highly, especially my friends, but now I've started believing that human life is disposable.

I think alot of people deserve to die. For example, I think serial killers deserve to die. They don't even deserve a chance at redemption in my books. More so, I believe that life is a privilege, not a right. I constantly think to myself ""maybe some people would be better off dead. We'd all be better off without some people."" I guess that probably comes from how low I view my own life. I see myself as disposable, and now I see everybody that way.

My dad has alot of health problems, and I can say with confidence that if he died tomorrow, I wouldn't care that much. If my friends or family die, I won't care that much at all. Again, I wish some people would die so they'd be out of my hair.

I know this is all jumbled and fucked up, and I know what I'm feeling isn't normal. But it feels totally natural to me. It feels like life has any worth, be it my own or others.

I have been suffering from depression and high anxiety (among others) since as early as age 5 (now 34). Up until recently I have never found anything or anyone that was able to help as I grew up. A few months ago I decided to create a webcomic with the goal being to help others who are dealing with these issues and going through tough times. Creatures of Habit (http://www.creaturesofhabit.ca) was born a week ago. It’s a story about a man’s journey through life dealing with his unwanted companions (depression, anxiety, social anxiety). It's a story about resiliency, determination, and perseverance. The comic updates every Wednesday. My goal with the story is to help both those who are currently suffering, and those who know of someone who is suffering. Throughout my life I never had anything or anyone I could turn to for help. I’m definitely not alone in that, but I want to do something to change that. That’s where the idea of Creatures of Habit arose. 

Unfortunately up until early this year I have never really done any drawing, but hopefully over time that will greatly improve. I’d like to invite you all to check out the comic, and hopefully over time the story will be able to help at least one person. If I can make a positive impact on one person, this whole journey will have been worth it. If you like it, please share the comic with others (social media, friends/family etc..).

the issue is that:

i tend to feel sometimes detached from people i know/love. the reason is not clear, but i have mental issues, a combination of depression and borderline personality.
this tendency came to an extreme with my boyfriend, i don't know why exactly, i guess that's because i am close to him, and most of the time i don't even get close to people. so sometimes i feel very detached from him, like one day i love him like crazy and the other day i feel like a barely know him, no emotion connection at all (the reasons that trigger it are very subtle/unnoticeable- sometimes it happens because i think he wasn't nice- when it's not the reality- he tells me a lot that he loves me, and he is very caring)

i tried to share this type of thoughts with him, about the alienation, 'cause i want him to get to know me better, and he tries to understand that, but still very frightened by that- sometimes we really fight over it. he urges me to start therapy.

anyway, yesterday he got an haircut. really cut most of his hair. i feel like he is another person, the alienation i feel is severe. it's not like he is ugly, or something. but i feel like he is a completely different person, i don't know how to handle it.

On the surface I am calm, cool and collected. I'm the type that you wouldn't think has any specific problems regarding the mental state but this is not true in the least. 

I've noticed that I get too attached to people and I end up letting that control my life. It's only come up recently and I do not know what to do.

For example, I really only feel attached to this one girl right now, it is imperative to note though, that this relationship is 110% platonic and is to stay that way. I have noticed over the last two weeks that she has distanced herself from me, not replying to messages and not being as open as in the past. And this drives me crazy with thoughts of abandonment, anxiety, and general nervousness/sadness

I do for a fact suppress a lot of the more ""serious"" emotions. I have not talked to the girl about any of them and kinda feel uncomfortable doing so.

The thing is, I don't know how to classify the problem I have and this is partly due to google searches.

I have googled ""attachment problems"" and things along the lines of that but have only found things and cases of how the person doesn't want attachment or is unusually asocial to family etc.

That part makes me think that this is all in my head but I am legitimately hurting and apologize to anyone if they feel like this ""attachment problem"" is not rooted in facts but I am lost.

Given my familial situation and other generals: I have an amazing family, roof over my head, food on the table, nice car kind of life, so I do not think it is my family's or growing up life's fault at all. 

I feel I am too/get to attached to people and it is unhealthy as I cannot stop thinking about it and drives me crazy.

Other symptoms/possible factors include:
Decreased appetite
Little sleep
In bed a lot
Sad

These other factors all seem to be the results of me searching to talk to this girl/ or any case where I feel too attached.

Also important that note: I have a very solid group of friends who care about me but sometimes chide me as all friends do, I spend a lot of time with them so telling me to spend more time with them wouldn't really make sense because Im very busy already

This problem is also distracting me from my studies , please help, I also don't know if I can talk to this with my parents or a professional because I feel rather uncomfortable about it.

I was recently diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder, and I'm considering suicide. This isn't a cry for help, a means to get attention, nor a condoning of the act, although borderlines are known for attention seeking. I want a personal opinion on whether or not you believe this is the ethical decision. I have been the primary source of my families dysfunction for the past few years, I would make an almost weekly suicide threat, and have recently turned to drugs. My parents, sister, and best friend are all pretty worried. I don't want them to worry, but I honestly and truly believe that they would be better off without me. My sister has crippling anxiety, so losing her primary stressor would relieve a great deal of that. My parents are going through financial hardship, so no longer need to pay for a second child's college should assist in that regard. Moving on to why the way I am, growing up I always viewed myself as the type of person who is filtered out during natural selection. I described myself as a defective product that needs to be removed from the assembly line. However, with this new diagnosis, it seems more like I should be putting down Old Yeller. Borderlines are generally viewed as abusive and unstable. All my relationships have ended in disaster. BPD's are essentially incapable of long-lasting relationships, so a family of my own is impossible. I will only be happy if I am loved so I need a family, my parents are quite old and won't last forever. I also display very manipulative tendencies. I have a romantic inclination toward my best friend. BPDs are defined by having and unimaginable fear of abandonment, I would often threaten suicide if I even remotely feared she would leave me. Her father left her so she doesn't want to give me the same fate, but I see I am taking my toll on her. But if I can so easily manipulate the one I love the most, perhaps I deserve to die. I can feel empathy for others so I know I'm not a sociopath, but I feel emotions on a rare occurrence. I only feel them when I can no longer control them due to intensity. So a life lived without love, hardly any feelings, and being a burden on my loved ones does not seem to be an ethical life.

Many are like me, barely hanging on financially, marginalized, and using state resources to pay for medication and care. All it would take is one event to polarize the nation and gain momentum for mass institutionalization. 

Several years ago I had a lithium overdose. Doctor prescribed too much and wasn't monitoring my levels. I had a seizure in the mall. At the ER the staff ran a lithium level and it was dangerously high. Without my medication bottle to prove I was taking it as prescribed it was ruled a suicide attempt and I spent a week in the psych wing. Even after my doctor called and explained the error. Just like that. A week of my life gone. No due process. No civil rights. We have less rights than the general public. I don't think many people realize that. I've spent 6 months in hospital before on a doctors say so. There is no oversight. We are incredibly vulnerable.

In the end, all we have is each other. What are we, as a community, going to do to make it? To keep from losing SSI, Medicare, Medicaid, Section 8, and all the other programs we count on.

If they turn on us nobody is going to help us. History proves it. My personal experience backs history up. Once you're labeled as ""other"" society gives itself a moral pass.

Taken all the anti-depressants, all SSRI's, all SNRI's, Tricyclics. 

Had ECT 14 times, works for a month. Can't handle getting a seizure induced under anesthesia so often. By the time I get my bearings and full cognitive capacity back following a treatment, it's time for another treatment. I was never afraid of the treatment but started having nightmares about it, being suffocated by the oxygen mask and recalling the seizure in my sleep. Apparently, my subconscious doesn't care for the treatment that much. 

I'm awaiting TMS, my local clinic only has one chair and my state's insurance companies only recently started covering the treatment. So there is a backlog of patients.

Doesn't help matters that my previous longtime psychiatrist/therapist got caught banging one of her patients and lost her medical license over it. Now I'm having a hard time locating my medical records. Cigna won't authorize TMS unless everything else has been attempted and failed,.and 8 years of treatment is currently missing. 

The longer I wait, the clearer it becomes that TMS may not be helpful to me at all. I'm trying to stay optimistic, but the evidence is weighing heavily on my optimism. 

I don't know what else I can do. I diet, exercise, and sleep. I've tried all the ""mental health"" diets. Went and had a sleep study done, I had some apnea so they gave me a CPAP, it doesn't help. When I'm having depressive episodes apparently the brain won't let you fall into rem sleep, and no drug can make that happen. Drugs like Ambien will put you out, but it doesn't mean you're going to sleep. 

I don't know what else to do. I have the desire to commit suicide, but I lack the conviction to do so. I constantly have to remind myself that it's not an option, just to put the thought out of my head. 

It's affecting my ability to work, so now I'm on my wife' s insurance. I've started to become cynical, I feel like doctors only become doctors to wear lab coats and make money and be called a doctor, it has nothing to do with helping people anymore. I can tell they're tired of trying to treat me, I don't blame them. It's hard to find a doctor who's up for a challenge. ",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,I don't know what else to do...

I have struggled with depression for a while and I went in one weekend when I was feeling particularly hopeless because I knew that it was the best place to go for emergency help (what my therapist advised me). I went in and felt good after the initial interview, which was with a nice lady that was friendly to talk to. They took my bag and my belongings, understandably. 

I was locked in the waiting room for seven hours without being given any updates. I had no idea what was going on - I had gone in alone and didn’t tell anyone I was there. They brought me in for three separate interviews with three different people (one of them was completely patronizing). I was asked the same questions over and over again in each interview, and when I asked for updates nobody would give me any. They finally let me leave after begging them because I didn’t want to be there any longer. I had initially gone in because I was having a breakdown and felt like I was going to hurt myself. I ended up leaving CAMH feeling worse than when I went in. 

Needless to say I am feeling very hopeless about getting help and my trust for mental health practitioners is basically non-existent. I am wondering if anyone has had similar experiences at CAMH? Maybe I won’t feel as isolated if I hear other stories. Also, does anyone have any advice on where to go for help with depression that is maybe not as discouraging as my experiences so far? On top of CAMH I have also had bad experiences with therapists and doctors. Also for the record I live in Toronto, so open to anything in the GTA.

I was curious if anyone else has ever experienced paranoia in the form of intrusive thoughts with Venlafaxine? I know a lot of people loathe the medicine and there are a lot of negative side effects, especially when stopping. I started venlafaxine over 2 years ago at 75mg and slowly increased to 150mg for the last year. It seemed to be working okay when combined with Welbutrin.


 Fast forward to about a month ago and I finally decided to bring up some issues I've had with my heart rate that has been going on for over 2 years to my internal medicine doctor. Basically what happens is that I will be sitting or laying down and my heart rate should be at a resting pulse. But, at random times it will jump up to over 115 and as high as 170. Then at other times, it feels like my heart is racing, I get out of breath and feel sick to my stomach but my heart rate is only around 80. I am a healthy male, 5'11"" 170lbs, average shape, I go hiking, like to play sports, and use the elliptical or stationary bike for cardio.  Long story short my doctor gave me a Holter monitor and then was going to give me beta blockers but due to something where the top chambers and lower chambers get out of sync every once in awhile he didn't feel comfortable with that. He decided to up my Venlafaxine to 225mg as he thought it might be anxiety.

This last month has been very weird. I have experienced what I consider paranoid irrational intrusive thoughts, especially at night time. I know these thoughts are not logical but the emotional side of me gets nervous/anxious even though the logical side is telling me to stop. For example, when I turn off the lights at night time and am walking to bed I fear that someone will be next to me trying to stab me as soon as the lights go off, or someone will rush me from down the hall. Another example is when walking outside at night time I am paranoid someone is behind trees waiting to attack me and they are running and hiding behind tree's until they have a perfect opportunity to attack. I know these aren't valid thoughts when I have them but I cannot get them out of my head and I start getting anxious no matter how many times I tell myself these thoughts are not valid. 

Has anyone else experienced anything like this? I am going to my doctor today and planning on telling my doctor. It does not feel like it has helped with the heart issues but instead made me more depressed/anxious and paranoid. I guess I need to be told that I am not absolutely insane or validation that it is the medicine. I am not sure actually what I need, I just felt like I needed to talk to others who might experience similar issues. 


Thanks in advance!

I'm not exactly a stereotypical loner; I've been trying to get involved in social activities recently (despite REALLY hating the people there), I can hold a conversation with a stranger relatively easily, and I have a small handful of friends online I can talk with about lots of things. I've also had a significant other in the past; however, it was a long distance relationship that took place entirely online, and we never actually met up. That in and of itself might be unhealthy, and it may contribute to why I justify having an imaginary S.O.

I'm concerned about whether or not having an imaginary S.O. is bad for my mental health. I only really ""hang out"" with her when I'm in bed, so it's not like I insert her in other parts of my day. I'm also totally self-aware of a.) how unusual it seems, and b.) the fact that it's entirely a fantasy of my creation, intended to make me feel as though I have a significant other. What I'm particularly concerned about is the fact that my pretend partner is actually a cartoon character. Not only is she a fictional character, she's a character I've had an attraction to for a long, long time. I only really stopped caring about her once I started a (virtual) relationship with a real person, and once that ended, it took quite a long time to imagine being with this character again because I felt like I was too old to keep doing it. I even did No Fap for 90+ days just to see if those feelings would dissipate (spoiler: they didn't). 

From what I've read, there isn't exactly a consensus on whether it's okay from a mental health perspective. The two leading opinions seem to be that it's either an unhealthy coping mechanism for dealing with loneliness, or perfectly healthy as long as it doesn't interfere with your everyday life (like I said, my imaginary S.O. doesn't really do that). I just want to know so I can take the appropriate action.

Is it normal or, more importantly, healthy to pretend I'm in a relationship with a fictional character? Does my self-awareness and relatively low-profile behavior with this ""person"" make it any healthier? I'm already going to ask these questions to my therapist the next time I see her, but I wanted to get a broader amount of opinions just to see if I can get a head start on taking whatever action I may need to take.",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,Is it mentally unhealthy to have an imaginary significant other?

I have mental health issues I'm not really functioning and cannot do anything of my own. After alerting my family they had little concern and showed little sympathy for me. I urged them to hire a professional because they know nothing about bed bugs. They won't do this and instead are intent on replacing the bed and mattress. They don't get that that's not a solution. These bed bugs could also be in other places and we don't know it. They could travel to the new bed/mattress. These bed bugs could've been in the mattress a long time without us realizing it. They're more concerned about where they came from (i.e. placing blame on myself and other housemates, being negative and denying) than coming up with a solution. When I try to explain my worries and offer my opinions they write me off, ignoring me and act like I'm crazy (seeing that I'm mentally ill this gives them reason to cast all sorts of judgments). Their solution sucks buying a new bed and mattress won't make the problem go away. We need a professional to examine the house. But they won't do it so IDK what to do. If you can imagine this has severely effected me to the point where my skin crawls and itches everytime I enter my room (that disgusting mattress and everything still in there and I need to get stuff out of my room). I am sleeping on the couch now but it haunts me at night because of how bed bugs travel. They keep insisting their beds and the couch are okay but how do they really know for sure? Why don't they get it that we need a professional? I told them this but they just won't listen to me. I was shaking yesterday and really emotional but my family was really an a**. This really effects me on a deep level for a number of reasons and the people in my life can't even be empathetic. They knew and know nothing about bed bugs but they still wanted to ""school"" me on it and act like they are professionals when they aren't. They didn't believe me when I told them, and even when they see them themselves they said crap like ""it's only one"", ""there's not that many"", even going as far to say that old mattress still looks good despite the fact there were clear blood stains on it from the bed bugs.",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,Bed Bug Problem and Mental Illness: Family refuses to hire professional

First off, I use a lot of social media. Many people use Facebook and Twitter but the website I associate myself with is Tumblr. Basically on Tumblr you make a blog and you reblog other things you like. It can be anything really as there will always be a topic or community you can relate to. My blog focuses on video games for the most part but it has a lot of other things too. There is no real theme I guess you could say.

One of my hobbies is drawing and art in general. I have been drawing for a long time since I was a kid but I was never particularly good at it. You know those people who like to do something but they never take it too seriously so nothing much comes out of it? I'm one of those people. I used to draw stick figures on paper with video game fan art being the recurring theme in my scribbles. Lately, I tried to improve my skill due to me simply getting frustrated with stick figures and I try to make my drawings look pseudo-realistic at least in the ""anime"" sense which the only reason my drawings look vaguely anime is because I'm taking after many Japanese game artist styles. Yeah, I know the hypocrisy with anime being realistic but I hope you know what I mean. But I apologize for rambling as this is only loosely relevant.

My problem is that when I use Tumblr (or any social media), I cannot help but browse through other more ""superior"" works of fan-art. I cannot fathom how someone is so good at a skill when I cannot ever see myself making pictures as gorgeous as some of the things I see on Tumblr. Then because the website has a like system (similar to upvotes on Reddit) you are even more aware of just how inferior you are to the most popular of artists. No doubt it is hard to become a successful artist, especially one that makes money off commissions, but this trend of displaying art on social media has done a massive number to my self-esteem. 

I hate myself. I hate myself so very much. The fact that it's so hard for me to draw art (let alone have the willpower to pick up a pencil) fills me with anger towards myself. One of my hobbies is actually collecting fan works for obscure video games and I very much enjoy doing that but this intense jealousy is something of a recent thing. I know a few people who are more professional than an amateur like me and they also draw stuff for commission money. Their entire livelihood involves drawing things for other people and getting paid for it. Part of me wants that existence but I also don't want my hobby to become work. I do not know why I hate myself so much or why I constantly compare myself to other people especially since I don't really believe talent exists so much as the human brain becomes more skilled in something the more times it attempts that skill. I honestly don't try very hard but it sure does seem like I try a whole lot. When I draw and I make a small error, I get angry about it. Multiple times I thought about ripping up my own sheets of paper which had failed artworks on them. Sometimes I scribble all over the paper and write big Xs with text like ""Why the hell did you draw this?"" and ""What are you doing with your life?""

There isn't any fun or relaxation in my hobby anymore and my constant use of Tumblr (which I use almost everyday, hours on end) inevitably exposes me to other people's gorgeous fan-art which I admire but also, at the same time, is my enemy. I am my own worst enemy actually. Nobody beats me down and makes me feel like trash the same way I do to myself daily. I hate that I cannot draw worth a damn. I have a deviantart account too (which I only used to upload some of my dumb drawings, the website is mostly populated by young people amateur artists like me) and when I look through my crappy gallery, I want to delete it all. Sometimes I think amateur artists like myself do not deserve to post their works online because it seems this world only loves those who are extremely skilled in their craft. Nobody cares about the so called worthless wannabe artists that think they made something cool that another person could possibly like. Essentially, because better people exist, I cannot love myself. This is obviously a destructive mindset so I would like help on how I can change my point of view. Thank you for taking the time to read this wall of text and once again, I apologize if I made an error in someway. 

TLDR: What can I do to accept the fact that I am a mediocre artist and that it's okay to be a mediocre artist? How do I stop comparing myself to people on social media who are better at their craft?",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,Social media and inability to respect myself

This issue is with my friend, let's call her Mary.  

Some Background Information 

This all started about 5 years ago when Mary (now 53) was diagnosed with depression, on top of her diagnosis of extreme anxiety. She spiraled downward and was only helped when her husband Joe dropped everything (work, hobbies, extended family etc.) to support her. Eventually she started regularly meeting with a therapist, taking the appropriate medication, joined weight watchers, and did some light activities and exercise.  

About a year ago we noticed she started eating very poorly, and stopped all exercise. Mary blamed it on menopause. In the summer she was diagnosed with a heart condition (Not sure of the name). Mary refused to eat healthy and exercise and instead chose to take medication to fix the issue.  

It's currently gotten to the point where Mary has lost almost all motivation to do anything. She no longer does any exercise stating that she can't ""because of her heart"", although I think that her anxiety has a lot to do with it. She won't even join the them on a Family walk around the block. She also refuses to eat healthy, it's not uncommon for her to eat half a tub of ice cream and a quarter of a cake a night, I think this may have to do with her depression.   

Joe and the rest of the family (kids) have all tried to bring her new poor habits to her attention. Mary laughs them off and continues on her way.  

She now refuses to accept any type of help, she won't go see a therapist, psychiatrist, psychologist, etc. And she cannot go back on her anxiety or depression medication because it interferes with her heart medication (or so I've been told).   

So here's where I need some advice! I am frustrated and we have tried so much, but Mary doesn't seem to grasp the concepts that her actions are affecting herself and those around her.

**TLDR:** My friend is Depressed and has high Anxiety, she refuses to change her poor lifestyle, see a therapist, and cannot take any medication. The family is getting frustrated because she won't make any changes to help herself.  

Questions: 

* How to you convince someone to get the mental health help they need if they can't see that they need it themselves?  Mary is aware of her previous diagnosis of depression and anxiety, but she says this time there is nothing she can do about it because of menopause and heart medication, and she is unwilling to try.  

* How do you get Mary to find the motivation within to eat healthy or exercise? Mary has already had a medical scare, the family continuously points out her new lifestyle but she brushes it off several times a day. Joe has even hired a nutritionist and weight coach for the two of them, but Mary has absolutely no interest. ",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,Caught in a Predicament any help is Appreciated [Canada]

I realized something the other day: I never notice getting close to people, or maybe I just don't get close to people. After getting to know someone a little bit, they'll hug me or show affection in some way and it usually confuses me. I enjoy being around these people and all but I never noticed that we were close enough for stuff like this. 

A while ago, a girl who I'd consider a friend said ""you're like a brother to me"" and I was happy because she's a really fun person but I just had no idea our relationship was that close. 

Usually what happens is the other person will kind of set the tone for the friendship and I just go along with it (ex. They start hugging me when we meet/say goodbye and then I start offering them as well in these scenarios). 

My problem is I feel everyone else has the ability to know exactly where the relationship is at but I have no clue. Is this a sign of slight autism or do I just suck at socializing? What can I do to improve this?

I'm 20, Male and in the UK and all I think about is suicide and homicide. This all started when I was relatively young and used to think about harming siblings or friends at school, at age 8 I went to see a therapist who concluded I had OCD as I used to obsessively hand-wash and have to repeat things otherwise I'd become anxious and distressed. 
Only once did I ever buckle and follow through with my 'intrusive thoughts', slamming a friends arm in a door for no reason other than the fact I had thought about it and impulsively followed through with the action. Eventually I lied and told my parents i was feeling better and urged them to stop therapy, which they did.

Fast forward to 13 and I was being extensively bullied, burned with lighters, beaten up, I even got pushed out of the school bus while it was still moving (slowing to a halt mind you). This was a very traumatic time for me as I'd wish I could just die, I'd cry every night after school and it broke my mums heart to see me like that but the guys responsible were at least 16 and far bigger than I was, I'd always been the type to stand up for myself no matter the size of my bully but this broke me and shattered any confidence I had.

For years afterwards I was the quiet kid in school, I'd sit at the back with earphones in and my head on the desk, teachers eventually realised I was not going to work and they left me to it. By 15 i was spending every waking moment fantasising about my own death or the deaths of those around me, I didn't tell a soul about how low, alone and worthless I felt.

One day after sixth form (I'd of been 18) I decided I'd had enough, my younger sister would be out late because of football, my parents were both working and I decided I'd end my life. I went home feeling slightly relieved I was finally going to rid myself of this horrible feeling. I'll cut the details but moments before I could do anything I felt a sudden wave of guilt and thought of my sister, I have two but I adore my younger one, she looks up to me and I'm very protective of her, the moment I thought about how much pain I'd put her through I felt sick and couldn't do it, instead I spent the afternoon crying and feeling awful. 

I eventually told my mum how I felt and she took me to see a doctor, I was referred to First Step and started to see a therapist who thought i was suffering from OCD. For reasons unknown to me I was referred to another therapist who told me that it was all in my head and that as long as I didn't act on my thoughts he didn't see the issue. I told him that I think about Necrophilia a lot and he told me ibwas just sexually frustrated and recommended I find myself a girlfriend. I couldn't believe it.

I stopped seeing him and decided I could go it alone.
Almost a year later and I'm worse than ever, I dont want to wake up every day, I don't want to see anyone, family, friends, coworkers, strangers. I just want to close my eyes and never wake up. I feel like I have a hole in my chest and no matter what I can't fill it. What is this? Is this life? I can't seem to move on or past this, people have gotten tired of me being so dark all the time, people are tired of hearing about my issues and how I feel. I have nobody. My closest friend feels uncomfortable when I open up, I don't blame him because what are you supposed to say when someone dumps all their issues on you?

I forgot to mention that I have self harmed in the past, rather severely one time. Nothing that required hospital but I do have a horrible 7 inch scar on my arm now and that's a constant reminder that I'm weak. At least in my eyes. I want to stop feeling numb and like nothing matters to me. I used to adore gaming and going out with friends and now I can't bring myself to even load up my console or get out of bed for nights out.

Please reddit can you give me some advice? 
What is wrong with me? 
How can I feel better?

I refuse to believe I feel this way because I don't have a relationship and that I'm just sexually frustrated (in actual fact, my sex drive is almost non existent).

He stays up all night drinking and talking to some fake catfish girl online while my mother can't sleep and shes in her 60s and works a full time job. He just drinks all night and goes to bed at 8 in the morning, then sleeps all day. Who can my mom call? She is having a very hard time with this and I don't know what to tell her. She goes back and forth because she's worried he'll die in the hospital and that he's too far gone for help, but also says she can't deal with this anymore.

He legally changed his last name for Religious reasons. And he's posting 4 or 5 times every hour, talking about how he his legally America's king. How our state senator is a traitor who will be assassinated. He's saying Obama and other senators not only did 9/11 but also killed all the jews in our state. I've read a couple days worh of his post and they're all very non-sensical and some are down right a little scarry. It seems he really believes that one of our state senators is the reason for all this suffering and he gears quite a bit of hate towards him.

I don't know Johnny too well I haven't spoken to him in a few years but he used to be a fairly normal kid and it seems as if something isn't quite right.

What are my options for getting him help? He seems really paranoid so getting the police to check up on him I think would only make things worse.

Recently, they have became pretty much consistent, and I'm no longer able to function day-to-day.

About a month ago, a friend managed to convince me to go to hospital (I'm still unsure *how*), but apparently I was quite out of it and rather paranoid. For about three-four weeks, I was pretty convinced the government was trying to control my mind (minor flaw with that idea; the UK government is too incompetent).

I've since had quite a lot of rather troubling hallucinations, and ended up being referred to the local Crisis Home Resolution Team after I tried to shove a knife through my stomach (I'd managed to convince myself someone had poisoned me... not sure how stabbing myself would've helped, but eh... :P)

Anyway, I've since been bounced between the CRHT, the local Community Mental Health Team, and the Early Intervention for Psychosis Team, and it seems like none of them are really listening to me.

For example; the last appointment I had with the CMHT, I had written quite a bit about... well, everything. They took a five second glance at it and went ""meh, ok."" I tried to insist they read it, but they just said they'll take a copy and read it later - fat chance that actually happened.

Anyway, their current working theory is Borderline Personality Disorder with Quasi-Psychotic symptoms. Which, maybe they are right, but as I say, it really seems like they aren't listening to me, and I don't really feel I fit most of the BPD criteria (which is rather amplified when they say I'm suffering from things I'm *really* not).

I'm not really sure what to do; on one hand, I really don't want to cause a fuss. They may be right, and I may just be overthinking things. But on the other hand, I don't want them to push me down the wrong path - CAMHS already did that to me as a teenager, and it took almost two years to recover afterwards. I can't help but feel this is happening again.

If it *is* happening again, I really need to bail. Like, now. But I'm not sure what to do in that situation; I really do need to get better, I can't live like this for much longer. Dealing with depression was a piece of cake compared to this; I'm scared and tired, and I just want it to stop.",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,Not sure what to do anymore...
