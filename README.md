Connecting Suicidal and Help-Seeking Behaviours
==================================================

### About ###
-----------------------------
Although there are lots of researchers and suicide prevention teams out there to help individuals with mentalhealth issues, many cases of suicide happen undetected. Social media provides a platform for users to express themselves online. Can we help such suicide prevention teams on social media to identify individuals who might later have suicidal thoughts due to mental health issues? The main goal of this project is to identify those individuals from social media who have suicidal thoughts and express their thoughts through general issues in their daily life. We have picked Reddit dataset to target users who had suicidal thoughts in the past and those users who just exhibit general issues like depression, anxiety etc. and express the same by posting in certain subreddits. No machine learning and classification algorithms work efficiently on the raw dataset. So, our next step is about preprocessing and data cleaning to extract relevant features out of the user’s posts for our classification algorithms. Next we perform topic modeling algorithm and support vector machine classification algorithm to classify the users based on their post in the given subreddits.
